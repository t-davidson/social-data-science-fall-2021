41360,INTRODUCTION,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,SUBJECT OF OUR STUDY: RELIGIOUS SOCIOLOGY AND THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In this book we propose to study the most primitive and simple religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"which is actually known, to make an analysis of it, and to attempt an",Elementary Forms
41360,explanation of it. A religious system may be said to be the most,Elementary Forms
41360,primitive which we can observe when it fulfils the two following,Elementary Forms
41360,"conditions: in the first place, when it is found in a society whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"organization is surpassed by no others in simplicity;[1] and secondly,",Elementary Forms
41360,when it is possible to explain it without making use of any element,Elementary Forms
41360,borrowed from a previous religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We shall set ourselves to describe the organization of this system with,Elementary Forms
41360,all the exactness and fidelity that an ethnographer or an historian,Elementary Forms
41360,could give it. But our task will not be limited to that: sociology,Elementary Forms
41360,raises other problems than history or ethnography. It does not seek to,Elementary Forms
41360,know the passed forms of civilization with the sole end of knowing them,Elementary Forms
41360,"and reconstructing them. But rather, like every positive science, it has",Elementary Forms
41360,as its object the explanation of some actual reality which is near to,Elementary Forms
41360,"us, and which consequently is capable of affecting our ideas and our",Elementary Forms
41360,"acts: this reality is man, and more precisely, the man of to-day, for",Elementary Forms
41360,there is nothing which we are more interested in knowing. Then we are,Elementary Forms
41360,not going to study a very archaic religion simply for the pleasure of,Elementary Forms
41360,telling its peculiarities and its singularities. If we have taken it as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the subject of our research, it is because it has seemed to us better",Elementary Forms
41360,adapted than any other to lead to an understanding of the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of man, that is to say, to show us an essential and permanent",Elementary Forms
41360,aspect of humanity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this proposition is not accepted before the raising of strong,Elementary Forms
41360,"objections. It seems very strange that one must turn back, and be",Elementary Forms
41360,"transported to the very beginnings of history, in order to arrive at an",Elementary Forms
41360,understanding of humanity as it is at present. This manner of procedure,Elementary Forms
41360,seems particularly paradoxical in the question which concerns us. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, the various religions generally pass as being quite unequal in",Elementary Forms
41360,value and dignity; it is said that they do not all contain the same,Elementary Forms
41360,quota of truth. Then it seems as though one could not compare the,Elementary Forms
41360,"highest forms of religious thought with the lowest, without reducing the",Elementary Forms
41360,first to the level of the second. If we admit that the crude cults of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Australian tribes can help us to understand Christianity, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, is that not supposing that this latter religion proceeds from",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same mentality as the former, that it is made up of the same",Elementary Forms
41360,superstitions and rests upon the same errors? This is how the,Elementary Forms
41360,theoretical importance which has sometimes been attributed to primitive,Elementary Forms
41360,religions has come to pass as a sign of a systematic hostility to all,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, which, by prejudging the results of the study, vitiates them",Elementary Forms
41360,in advance.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There is no occasion for asking here whether or not there are scholars,Elementary Forms
41360,"who have merited this reproach, and who have made religious history and",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnology a weapon against religion. In any case, a sociologist cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,"hold such a point of view. In fact, it is an essential postulate of",Elementary Forms
41360,"sociology that a human institution cannot rest upon an error and a lie,",Elementary Forms
41360,without which it could not exist. If it were not founded in the nature,Elementary Forms
41360,"of things, it would have encountered in the facts a resistance over",Elementary Forms
41360,which it could never have triumphed. So when we commence the study of,Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive religions, it is with the assurance that they hold to reality",Elementary Forms
41360,and express it; this principle will be seen to re-enter again and again,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the course of the analyses and discussions which follow, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,reproach which we make against the schools from which we have separated,Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves is that they have ignored it. When only the letter of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"formulae is considered, these religious beliefs and practices undoubtedly",Elementary Forms
41360,"seem disconcerting at times, and one is tempted to attribute them to",Elementary Forms
41360,some sort of a deep-rooted error. But one must know how to go underneath,Elementary Forms
41360,the symbol to the reality which it represents and which gives it its,Elementary Forms
41360,meaning. The most barbarous and the most fantastic rites and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"strangest myths translate some human need, some aspect of life, either",Elementary Forms
41360,individual or social. The reasons with which the faithful justify them,Elementary Forms
41360,"may be, and generally are, erroneous; but the true reasons do not cease",Elementary Forms
41360,"to exist, and it is the duty of science to discover them.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In reality, then, there are no religions which are false. All are true",Elementary Forms
41360,"in their own fashion; all answer, though in different ways, to the given",Elementary Forms
41360,conditions of human existence. It is undeniably possible to arrange them,Elementary Forms
41360,"in a hierarchy. Some can be called superior to others, in the sense that",Elementary Forms
41360,"they call into play higher mental functions, that they are richer in",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas and sentiments, that they contain more concepts with fewer",Elementary Forms
41360,"sensations and images, and that their arrangement is wiser. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"howsoever real this greater complexity and this higher ideality may be,",Elementary Forms
41360,they are not sufficient to place the corresponding religions in,Elementary Forms
41360,"different classes. All are religions equally, just as all living beings",Elementary Forms
41360,"are equally alive, from the most humble plastids up to man. So when we",Elementary Forms
41360,turn to primitive religions it is not with the idea of depreciating,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion in general, for these religions are no less respectable than",Elementary Forms
41360,"the others. They respond to the same needs, they play the same role,",Elementary Forms
41360,they depend upon the same causes; they can also well serve to show the,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of the religious life, and consequently to resolve the problem",Elementary Forms
41360,which we wish to study.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But why give them a sort of prerogative? Why choose them in preference,Elementary Forms
41360,to all others as the subject of our study?--It is merely for reasons of,Elementary Forms
41360,method.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, we cannot arrive at an understanding of the most",Elementary Forms
41360,recent religions except by following the manner in which they have been,Elementary Forms
41360,"progressively composed in history. In fact, historical analysis is the",Elementary Forms
41360,only means of explanation which it is possible to apply to them. It,Elementary Forms
41360,alone enables us to resolve an institution into its constituent,Elementary Forms
41360,"elements, for it shows them to us as they are born in time, one after",Elementary Forms
41360,"another. On the other hand, by placing every one of them in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"condition where it was born, it puts into our hands the only means we",Elementary Forms
41360,have of determining the causes which gave rise to it. Every time that we,Elementary Forms
41360,"undertake to explain something human, taken at a given moment in",Elementary Forms
41360,"history--be it a religious belief, a moral precept, a legal principle,",Elementary Forms
41360,an aesthetic style or an economic system--it is necessary to commence by,Elementary Forms
41360,"going back to its most primitive and simple form, to try to account for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the characteristics by which it was marked at that time, and then to",Elementary Forms
41360,"show how it developed and became complicated little by little, and how",Elementary Forms
41360,it became that which it is at the moment in question. One readily,Elementary Forms
41360,understands the importance which the determination of the point of,Elementary Forms
41360,"departure has for this series of progressive explanations, for all the",Elementary Forms
41360,others are attached to it. It was one of Descartes's principles that,Elementary Forms
41360,the first ring has a predominating place in the chain of scientific,Elementary Forms
41360,truths. But there is no question of placing at the foundation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"science of religions an idea elaborated after the cartesian manner, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, a logical concept, a pure possibility, constructed simply by",Elementary Forms
41360,"force of thought. What we must find is a concrete reality, and",Elementary Forms
41360,historical and ethnological observation alone can reveal that to us. But,Elementary Forms
41360,even if this cardinal conception is obtained by a different process than,Elementary Forms
41360,"that of Descartes, it remains true that it is destined to have a",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable influence on the whole series of propositions which the,Elementary Forms
41360,science establishes. Biological evolution has been conceived quite,Elementary Forms
41360,differently ever since it has been known that monocellular beings do,Elementary Forms
41360,"exist. In the same way, the arrangement of religious facts is explained",Elementary Forms
41360,"quite differently, according as we put naturism, animism or some other",Elementary Forms
41360,religious form at the beginning of the evolution. Even the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"specialized scholars, if they are unwilling to confine themselves to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"task of pure erudition, and if they desire to interpret the facts which",Elementary Forms
41360,"they analyse, are obliged to choose one of these hypotheses, and make it",Elementary Forms
41360,"their starting-point. Whether they desire it or not, the questions which",Elementary Forms
41360,they raise necessarily take the following form: how has naturism or,Elementary Forms
41360,"animism been led to take this particular form, here or there, or to",Elementary Forms
41360,enrich itself or impoverish itself in such and such a fashion? Since it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is impossible to avoid taking sides on this initial problem, and since",Elementary Forms
41360,"the solution given is destined to affect the whole science, it must be",Elementary Forms
41360,attacked at the outset: that is what we propose to do.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Besides this, outside of these indirect reactions, the study of",Elementary Forms
41360,primitive religions has of itself an immediate interest which is of,Elementary Forms
41360,primary importance.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If it is useful to know what a certain particular religion consists in,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is still more important to know what religion in general is. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,the problem which has aroused the interest of philosophers in all times;,Elementary Forms
41360,"and not without reason, for it is of interest to all humanity.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Unfortunately, the method which they generally employ is purely",Elementary Forms
41360,dialectic: they confine themselves to analysing the idea which they make,Elementary Forms
41360,"for themselves of religion, except as they illustrate the results of",Elementary Forms
41360,this mental analysis by examples borrowed from the religions which best,Elementary Forms
41360,"realize their ideal. But even if this method ought to be abandoned, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"problem remains intact, and the great service of philosophy is to have",Elementary Forms
41360,prevented its being suppressed by the disdain of scholars. Now it is,Elementary Forms
41360,possible to attack it in a different way. Since all religions can be,Elementary Forms
41360,"compared to each other, and since all are species of the same class,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are necessarily many elements which are common to all. We do not,Elementary Forms
41360,mean to speak simply of the outward and visible characteristics which,Elementary Forms
41360,"they all have equally, and which make it possible to give them a",Elementary Forms
41360,provisional definition from the very outset of our researches; the,Elementary Forms
41360,"discovery of these apparent signs is relatively easy, for the",Elementary Forms
41360,observation which it demands does not go beneath the surface of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,But these external resemblances suppose others which are profound. At,Elementary Forms
41360,the foundation of all systems of beliefs and of all cults there ought,Elementary Forms
41360,necessarily to be a certain number of fundamental representations or,Elementary Forms
41360,"conceptions and of ritual attitudes which, in spite of the diversity of",Elementary Forms
41360,"forms which they have taken, have the same objective significance and",Elementary Forms
41360,fulfil the same functions everywhere. These are the permanent elements,Elementary Forms
41360,which constitute that which is permanent and human in religion; they,Elementary Forms
41360,form all the objective contents of the idea which is expressed when one,Elementary Forms
41360,speaks of _religion_ in general. How is it possible to pick them out?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Surely it is not by observing the complex religions which appear in the,Elementary Forms
41360,course of history. Every one of these is made up of such a variety of,Elementary Forms
41360,elements that it is very difficult to distinguish what is secondary from,Elementary Forms
41360,"what is principal, the essential from the accessory. Suppose that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion considered is like that of Egypt, India or the classical",Elementary Forms
41360,"antiquity. It is a confused mass of many cults, varying according to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"locality, the temples, the generations, the dynasties, the invasions,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc. Popular superstitions are there confused with the purest dogmas.,Elementary Forms
41360,Neither the thought nor the activity of the religion is evenly,Elementary Forms
41360,"distributed among the believers; according to the men, the environment",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the circumstances, the beliefs as well as the rites are thought of",Elementary Forms
41360,"in different ways. Here they are priests, there they are monks,",Elementary Forms
41360,"elsewhere they are laymen; there are mystics and rationalists,",Elementary Forms
41360,"theologians and prophets, etc. In these conditions it is difficult to",Elementary Forms
41360,see what is common to all. In one or another of these systems it is,Elementary Forms
41360,quite possible to find the means of making a profitable study of some,Elementary Forms
41360,"particular fact which is specially developed there, such as sacrifice or",Elementary Forms
41360,"prophecy, monasticism or the mysteries; but how is it possible to find",Elementary Forms
41360,the common foundation of the religious life underneath the luxuriant,Elementary Forms
41360,"vegetation which covers it? How is it possible to find, underneath the",Elementary Forms
41360,"disputes of theology, the variations of ritual, the multiplicity of",Elementary Forms
41360,"groups and the diversity of individuals, the fundamental states",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristic of religious mentality in general?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Things are quite different in the lower societies. The slighter,Elementary Forms
41360,"development of individuality, the small extension of the group, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"homogeneity of external circumstances, all contribute to reducing the",Elementary Forms
41360,differences and variations to a minimum. The group has an intellectual,Elementary Forms
41360,and moral conformity of which we find but rare examples in the more,Elementary Forms
41360,advanced societies. Everything is common to all. Movements are,Elementary Forms
41360,"stereotyped; everybody performs the same ones in the same circumstances,",Elementary Forms
41360,and this conformity of conduct only translates the conformity of,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought. Every mind being drawn into the same eddy, the individual type",Elementary Forms
41360,"nearly confounds itself with that of the race. And while all is uniform,",Elementary Forms
41360,"all is simple as well. Nothing is deformed like these myths, all",Elementary Forms
41360,"composed of one and the same theme which is endlessly repeated, or like",Elementary Forms
41360,these rites made up of a small number of gestures repeated again and,Elementary Forms
41360,again. Neither the popular imagination nor that of the priests has had,Elementary Forms
41360,either the time or the means of refining and transforming the original,Elementary Forms
41360,substance of the religious ideas and practices; these are shown in all,Elementary Forms
41360,"their nudity, and offer themselves to an examination, it requiring only",Elementary Forms
41360,the slightest effort to lay them open. That which is accessory or,Elementary Forms
41360,"secondary, the development of luxury, has not yet come to hide the",Elementary Forms
41360,"principal elements.[2] All is reduced to that which is indispensable, to",Elementary Forms
41360,that without which there could be no religion. But that which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"indispensable is also that which is essential, that is to say, that",Elementary Forms
41360,which we must know before all else.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Primitive civilizations offer privileged cases, then, because they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"simple cases. That is why, in all fields of human activity, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"observations of ethnologists have frequently been veritable revelations,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which have renewed the study of human institutions. For example, before",Elementary Forms
41360,"the middle of the nineteenth century, everybody was convinced that the",Elementary Forms
41360,father was the essential element of the family; no one had dreamed that,Elementary Forms
41360,there could be a family organization of which the paternal authority was,Elementary Forms
41360,not the keystone. But the discovery of Bachofen came and upset this old,Elementary Forms
41360,conception. Up to very recent times it was regarded as evident that the,Elementary Forms
41360,moral and legal relations of kindred were only another aspect of the,Elementary Forms
41360,psychological relations which result from a common descent; Bachofen and,Elementary Forms
41360,"his successors, MacLennan, Morgan and many others still laboured under",Elementary Forms
41360,this misunderstanding. But since we have become acquainted with the,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of the primitive clan, we know that, on the contrary,",Elementary Forms
41360,relationships cannot be explained by consanguinity. To return to,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, the study of only the most familiar ones had led men to",Elementary Forms
41360,believe for a long time that the idea of god was characteristic of,Elementary Forms
41360,everything that is religious. Now the religion which we are going to,Elementary Forms
41360,"study presently is, in a large part, foreign to all idea of divinity;",Elementary Forms
41360,the forces to which the rites are there addressed are very different,Elementary Forms
41360,"from those which occupy the leading place in our modern religions, yet",Elementary Forms
41360,they aid us in understanding these latter forces. So nothing is more,Elementary Forms
41360,unjust than the disdain with which too many historians still regard the,Elementary Forms
41360,"work of ethnographers. Indeed, it is certain that ethnology has",Elementary Forms
41360,frequently brought about the most fruitful revolutions in the different,Elementary Forms
41360,branches of sociology. It is for this same reason that the discovery of,Elementary Forms
41360,"unicellular beings, of which we just spoke, has transformed the current",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of life. Since in these very simple beings, life is reduced to its",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential traits, these are less easily misunderstood.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But primitive religions do not merely aid us in disengaging the,Elementary Forms
41360,constituent elements of religion; they also have the great advantage,Elementary Forms
41360,that they facilitate the explanation of it. Since the facts there are,Elementary Forms
41360,"simpler, the relations between them are more apparent. The reasons with",Elementary Forms
41360,which men account for their acts have not yet been elaborated and,Elementary Forms
41360,denatured by studied reflection; they are nearer and more closely,Elementary Forms
41360,related to the motives which have really determined these acts. In order,Elementary Forms
41360,"to understand an hallucination perfectly, and give it its most",Elementary Forms
41360,"appropriate treatment, a physician must know its original point of",Elementary Forms
41360,departure. Now this event is proportionately easier to find if he can,Elementary Forms
41360,observe it near its beginnings. The longer the disease is allowed to,Elementary Forms
41360,"develop, the more it evades observation; that is because all sorts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"interpretations have intervened as it advanced, which tend to force the",Elementary Forms
41360,"original state into the background, and across which it is frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,difficult to find the initial one. Between a systematized hallucination,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the first impressions which gave it birth, the distance is often",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable. It is the same thing with religious thought. In proportion,Elementary Forms
41360,"as it progresses in history, the causes which called it into existence,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though remaining active, are no longer perceived, except across a vast",Elementary Forms
41360,scheme of interpretations which quite transform them. Popular,Elementary Forms
41360,mythologies and subtile theologies have done their work: they have,Elementary Forms
41360,superimposed upon the primitive sentiments others which are quite,Elementary Forms
41360,"different, and which, though holding to the first, of which they are an",Elementary Forms
41360,"elaborated form, only allow their true nature to appear very",Elementary Forms
41360,"imperfectly. The psychological gap between the cause and the effect,",Elementary Forms
41360,"between the apparent cause and the effective cause, has become more",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable and more difficult for the mind to leap. The remainder of,Elementary Forms
41360,this book will be an illustration and a verification of this remark on,Elementary Forms
41360,"method. It will be seen how, in the primitive religions, the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,fact still visibly carries the mark of its origins: it would have been,Elementary Forms
41360,well-nigh impossible to infer them merely from the study of the more,Elementary Forms
41360,developed religions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The study which we are undertaking is therefore a way of taking up,Elementary Forms
41360,"again, _but under new conditions_, the old problem of the origin of",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion. To be sure, if by origin we are to understand the very first",Elementary Forms
41360,"beginning, the question has nothing scientific about it, and should be",Elementary Forms
41360,resolutely discarded. There was no given moment when religion began to,Elementary Forms
41360,"exist, and there is consequently no need of finding a means of",Elementary Forms
41360,"transporting ourselves thither in thought. Like every human institution,",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion did not commence anywhere. Therefore, all speculations of this",Elementary Forms
41360,sort are justly discredited; they can only consist in subjective and,Elementary Forms
41360,arbitrary constructions which are subject to no sort of control. But the,Elementary Forms
41360,problem which we raise is quite another one. What we want to do is to,Elementary Forms
41360,find a means of discerning the ever-present causes upon which the most,Elementary Forms
41360,essential forms of religious thought and practice depend. Now for the,Elementary Forms
41360,"reasons which were just set forth, these causes are proportionately more",Elementary Forms
41360,easily observable as the societies where they are observed are less,Elementary Forms
41360,complicated. That is why we try to get as near as possible to the,Elementary Forms
41360,origins.[3] It is not that we ascribe particular virtues to the lower,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions. On the contrary, they are rudimentary and gross; we cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,make of them a sort of model which later religions only have to,Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduce. But even their grossness makes them instructive, for they",Elementary Forms
41360,"thus become convenient for experiments, as in them, the facts and their",Elementary Forms
41360,relations are easily seen. In order to discover the laws of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena which he studies, the physicist tries to simplify these latter",Elementary Forms
41360,and rid them of their secondary characteristics. For that which concerns,Elementary Forms
41360,"institutions, nature spontaneously makes the same sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,simplifications at the beginning of history. We merely wish to put these,Elementary Forms
41360,to profit. Undoubtedly we can only touch very elementary facts by this,Elementary Forms
41360,"method. When we shall have accounted for them as far as possible, the",Elementary Forms
41360,novelties of every sort which have been produced in the course of,Elementary Forms
41360,evolution will not yet be explained. But while we do not dream of,Elementary Forms
41360,"denying the importance of the problems thus raised, we think that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"will profit by being treated in their turn, and that it is important to",Elementary Forms
41360,take them up only after those of which we are going to undertake the,Elementary Forms
41360,study at present.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But our study is not of interest merely for the science of religion. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, every religion has one side by which it overlaps the circle of",Elementary Forms
41360,"properly religious ideas, and there, the study of religious phenomena",Elementary Forms
41360,"gives a means of renewing the problems which, up to the present, have",Elementary Forms
41360,only been discussed among philosophers.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,For a long time it has been known that the first systems of,Elementary Forms
41360,representations with which men have pictured to themselves the world and,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves were of religious origin. There is no religion that is not a,Elementary Forms
41360,cosmology at the same time that it is a speculation upon divine things.,Elementary Forms
41360,"If philosophy and the sciences were born of religion, it is because",Elementary Forms
41360,religion began by taking the place of the sciences and philosophy. But,Elementary Forms
41360,it has been less frequently noticed that religion has not confined,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself to enriching the human intellect, formed beforehand, with a",Elementary Forms
41360,certain number of ideas; it has contributed to forming the intellect,Elementary Forms
41360,itself. Men owe to it not only a good part of the substance of their,Elementary Forms
41360,"knowledge, but also the form in which this knowledge has been",Elementary Forms
41360,elaborated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,At the roots of all our judgments there are a certain number of,Elementary Forms
41360,essential ideas which dominate all our intellectual life; they are what,Elementary Forms
41360,philosophers since Aristotle have called the categories of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"understanding: ideas of time, space,[4] class, number, cause, substance,",Elementary Forms
41360,"personality, etc. They correspond to the most universal properties of",Elementary Forms
41360,things. They are like the solid frame which encloses all thought; this,Elementary Forms
41360,does not seem to be able to liberate itself from them without destroying,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, for it seems that we cannot think of objects that are not in",Elementary Forms
41360,"time and space, which have no number, etc. Other ideas are contingent",Elementary Forms
41360,"and unsteady; we can conceive of their being unknown to a man, a society",Elementary Forms
41360,or an epoch; but these others appear to be nearly inseparable from the,Elementary Forms
41360,normal working of the intellect. They are like the framework of the,Elementary Forms
41360,intelligence. Now when primitive religious beliefs are systematically,Elementary Forms
41360,"analysed, the principal categories are naturally found. They are born in",Elementary Forms
41360,religion and of religion; they are a product of religious thought. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is a statement that we are going to have occasion to make many times in,Elementary Forms
41360,the course of this work.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This remark has some interest of itself already; but here is what gives,Elementary Forms
41360,it its real importance.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The general conclusion of the book which the reader has before him is,Elementary Forms
41360,that religion is something eminently social. Religious representations,Elementary Forms
41360,are collective representations which express collective realities; the,Elementary Forms
41360,rites are a manner of acting which take rise in the midst of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"assembled groups and which are destined to excite, maintain or recreate",Elementary Forms
41360,certain mental states in these groups. So if the categories are of,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious origin, they ought to participate in this nature common to all",Elementary Forms
41360,religious facts; they too should be social affairs and the product of,Elementary Forms
41360,collective thought. At least--for in the actual condition of our,Elementary Forms
41360,"knowledge of these matters, one should be careful to avoid all radical",Elementary Forms
41360,and exclusive statements--it is allowable to suppose that they are rich,Elementary Forms
41360,in social elements.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Even at present, these can be imperfectly seen in some of them. For",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, try to represent what the notion of time would be without the",Elementary Forms
41360,"processes by which we divide it, measure it or express it with objective",Elementary Forms
41360,"signs, a time which is not a succession of years, months, weeks, days",Elementary Forms
41360,and hours! This is something nearly unthinkable. We cannot conceive of,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, except on condition of distinguishing its different moments. Now",Elementary Forms
41360,"what is the origin of this differentiation? Undoubtedly, the states of",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness which we have already experienced can be reproduced in us,Elementary Forms
41360,in the same order in which they passed in the first place; thus portions,Elementary Forms
41360,"of our past become present again, though being clearly distinguished",Elementary Forms
41360,from the present. But howsoever important this distinction may be for,Elementary Forms
41360,"our private experience, it is far from being enough to constitute the",Elementary Forms
41360,notion or category of time. This does not consist merely in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"commemoration, either partial or integral, of our past life. It is an",Elementary Forms
41360,"abstract and impersonal frame which surrounds, not only our individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"existence, but that of all humanity. It is like an endless chart, where",Elementary Forms
41360,"all duration is spread out before the mind, and upon which all possible",Elementary Forms
41360,events can be located in relation to fixed and determined guide lines.,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is not _my time_ that is thus arranged; it is time in general, such",Elementary Forms
41360,as it is objectively thought of by everybody in a single civilization.,Elementary Forms
41360,That alone is enough to give us a hint that such an arrangement ought to,Elementary Forms
41360,"be collective. And in reality, observation proves that these",Elementary Forms
41360,"indispensable guide lines, in relation to which all things are",Elementary Forms
41360,"temporally located, are taken from social life. The divisions into days,",Elementary Forms
41360,"weeks, months, years, etc., correspond to the periodical recurrence of",Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, feasts, and public ceremonies.[5] A calendar expresses the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rhythm of the collective activities, while at the same time its function",Elementary Forms
41360,is to assure their regularity.[6],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is the same thing with space. As Hamelin has shown,[7] space is not",Elementary Forms
41360,the vague and indetermined medium which Kant imagined; if purely and,Elementary Forms
41360,"absolutely homogeneous, it would be of no use, and could not be grasped",Elementary Forms
41360,by the mind. Spatial representation consists essentially in a primary,Elementary Forms
41360,co-ordination of the data of sensuous experience. But this co-ordination,Elementary Forms
41360,would be impossible if the parts of space were qualitatively equivalent,Elementary Forms
41360,and if they were really interchangeable. To dispose things spatially,Elementary Forms
41360,"there must be a possibility of placing them differently, of putting some",Elementary Forms
41360,"at the right, others at the left, these above, those below, at the north",Elementary Forms
41360,"of or at the south of, east or west of, etc., etc., just as to dispose",Elementary Forms
41360,states of consciousness temporally there must be a possibility of,Elementary Forms
41360,localizing them at determined dates. That is to say that space could not,Elementary Forms
41360,"be what it is if it were not, like time, divided and differentiated. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"whence come these divisions which are so essential? By themselves, there",Elementary Forms
41360,"are neither right nor left, up nor down, north nor south, etc. All these",Elementary Forms
41360,distinctions evidently come from the fact that different sympathetic,Elementary Forms
41360,values have been attributed to various regions. Since all the men of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"single civilization represent space in the same way, it is clearly",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary that these sympathetic values, and the distinctions which",Elementary Forms
41360,"depend upon them, should be equally universal, and that almost",Elementary Forms
41360,necessarily implies that they be of social origin.[8],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Besides that, there are cases where this social character is made",Elementary Forms
41360,manifest. There are societies in Australia and North America where space,Elementary Forms
41360,"is conceived in the form of an immense circle, because the camp has a",Elementary Forms
41360,circular form;[9] and this spatial circle is divided up exactly like the,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribal circle, and is in its image. There are as many regions",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguished as there are clans in the tribe, and it is the place",Elementary Forms
41360,occupied by the clans inside the encampment which has determined the,Elementary Forms
41360,orientation of these regions. Each region is defined by the totem of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clan to which it is assigned. Among the Zuni, for example, the pueblo",Elementary Forms
41360,contains seven quarters; each of these is a group of clans which has had,Elementary Forms
41360,a unity: in all probability it was originally a single clan which was,Elementary Forms
41360,"later subdivided. Now their space also contains seven quarters, and each",Elementary Forms
41360,of these seven quarters of the world is in intimate connection with a,Elementary Forms
41360,"quarter of the pueblo, that is to say with a group of clans.[10] ""Thus,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"says Cushing, ""one division is thought to be in relation with the north,",Elementary Forms
41360,"another represents the west, another the south,"" etc.[11] Each quarter",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the pueblo has its characteristic colour, which symbolizes it; each",Elementary Forms
41360,"region has its colour, which is exactly the same as that of the",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding quarter. In the course of history the number of,Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental clans has varied; the number of the fundamental regions of,Elementary Forms
41360,space has varied with them. Thus the social organization has been the,Elementary Forms
41360,model for the spatial organization and a reproduction of it. It is thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"even up to the distinction between right and left which, far from being",Elementary Forms
41360,"inherent in the nature of man in general, is very probably the product",Elementary Forms
41360,of representations which are religious and therefore collective.[12],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Analogous proofs will be found presently in regard to the ideas of,Elementary Forms
41360,"class, force, personality and efficacy. It is even possible to ask if",Elementary Forms
41360,the idea of contradiction does not also depend upon social conditions.,Elementary Forms
41360,What makes one tend to believe this is that the empire which the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,has exercised over human thought has varied with times and societies.,Elementary Forms
41360,To-day the principle of identity dominates scientific thought; but there,Elementary Forms
41360,are vast systems of representations which have played a considerable,Elementary Forms
41360,role in the history of ideas where it has frequently been set aside:,Elementary Forms
41360,"these are the mythologies, from the grossest up to the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"reasonable.[13] There, we are continually coming upon beings which have",Elementary Forms
41360,"the most contradictory attributes simultaneously, who are at the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"time one and many, material and spiritual, who can divide themselves up",Elementary Forms
41360,indefinitely without losing anything of their constitution; in mythology,Elementary Forms
41360,it is an axiom that the part is worth the whole. These variations,Elementary Forms
41360,through which the rules which seem to govern our present logic have,Elementary Forms
41360,"passed prove that, far from being engraven through all eternity upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"mental constitution of men, they depend, at least in part, upon factors",Elementary Forms
41360,that are historical and consequently social. We do not know exactly what,Elementary Forms
41360,"they are, but we may presume that they exist.[14]",Elementary Forms

41360,"This hypothesis once admitted, the problem of knowledge is posed in new",Elementary Forms
41360,terms.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Up to the present there have been only two doctrines in the field. For,Elementary Forms
41360,"some, the categories cannot be derived from experience: they are",Elementary Forms
41360,logically prior to it and condition it. They are represented as so many,Elementary Forms
41360,"simple and irreducible data, imminent in the human mind by virtue of its",Elementary Forms
41360,inborn constitution. For this reason they are said to be _a priori_.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Others, however, hold that they are constructed and made up of pieces",Elementary Forms
41360,"and bits, and that the individual is the artisan of this",Elementary Forms
41360,construction.[15],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But each solution raises grave difficulties.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Is the empirical thesis the one adopted? Then it is necessary to deprive,Elementary Forms
41360,the categories of all their characteristic properties. As a matter of,Elementary Forms
41360,fact they are distinguished from all other knowledge by their,Elementary Forms
41360,universality and necessity. They are the most general concepts which,Elementary Forms
41360,"exist, because they are applicable to all that is real, and since they",Elementary Forms
41360,are not attached to any particular object they are independent of every,Elementary Forms
41360,particular subject; they constitute the common field where all minds,Elementary Forms
41360,"meet. Further, they must meet there, for reason, which is nothing more",Elementary Forms
41360,"than all the fundamental categories taken together, is invested with an",Elementary Forms
41360,authority which we could not set aside if we would. When we attempt to,Elementary Forms
41360,"revolt against it, and to free ourselves from some of these essential",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas, we meet with great resistances. They do not merely depend upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"us, but they impose themselves upon us. Now empirical data present",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics which are diametrically opposed to these. A sensation or,Elementary Forms
41360,"an image always relies upon a determined object, or upon a collection of",Elementary Forms
41360,"objects of the same sort, and expresses the momentary condition of a",Elementary Forms
41360,particular consciousness; it is essentially individual and subjective.,Elementary Forms
41360,We therefore have considerable liberty in dealing with the,Elementary Forms
41360,representations of such an origin. It is true that when our sensations,Elementary Forms
41360,"are actual, they impose themselves upon us _in fact_. But _by right_ we",Elementary Forms
41360,"are free to conceive them otherwise than they really are, or to",Elementary Forms
41360,represent them to ourselves as occurring in a different order from that,Elementary Forms
41360,where they are really produced. In regard to them nothing is forced upon,Elementary Forms
41360,us except as considerations of another sort intervene. Thus we find that,Elementary Forms
41360,"we have here two sorts of knowledge, which are like the two opposite",Elementary Forms
41360,poles of the intelligence. Under these conditions forcing reason back,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon experience causes it to disappear, for it is equivalent to reducing",Elementary Forms
41360,"the universality and necessity which characterize it to pure appearance,",Elementary Forms
41360,"to an illusion which may be useful practically, but which corresponds to",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing in reality; consequently it is denying all objective reality to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the logical life, whose regulation and organization is the function of",Elementary Forms
41360,the categories. Classical empiricism results in irrationalism; perhaps,Elementary Forms
41360,it would even be fitting to designate it by this latter name.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In spite of the sense ordinarily attached to the name, the apriorists",Elementary Forms
41360,have more respect for the facts. Since they do not admit it as a truth,Elementary Forms
41360,established by evidence that the categories are made up of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"elements as our sensual representations, they are not obliged to",Elementary Forms
41360,"impoverish them systematically, to draw from them all their real",Elementary Forms
41360,"content, and to reduce them to nothing more than verbal artifices. On",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, they leave them all their specific characteristics. The",Elementary Forms
41360,apriorists are the rationalists; they believe that the world has a,Elementary Forms
41360,"logical aspect which the reason expresses excellently. But for all that,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is necessary for them to give the mind a certain power of,Elementary Forms
41360,transcending experience and of adding to that which is given to it,Elementary Forms
41360,directly; and of this singular power they give neither explanation nor,Elementary Forms
41360,justification. For it is no explanation to say that it is inherent in,Elementary Forms
41360,the nature of the human intellect. It is necessary to show whence we,Elementary Forms
41360,hold this surprising prerogative and how it comes that we can see,Elementary Forms
41360,certain relations in things which the examination of these things cannot,Elementary Forms
41360,reveal to us. Saying that only on this condition is experience itself,Elementary Forms
41360,"possible changes the problem perhaps, but does not answer it. For the",Elementary Forms
41360,real question is to know how it comes that experience is not sufficient,Elementary Forms
41360,"unto itself, but presupposes certain conditions which are exterior and",Elementary Forms
41360,"prior to it, and how it happens that these conditions are realized at",Elementary Forms
41360,the moment and in the manner that is desirable. To answer these,Elementary Forms
41360,questions it has sometimes been assumed that above the reason of,Elementary Forms
41360,individuals there is a superior and perfect reason from which the others,Elementary Forms
41360,"emanate and from which they get this marvellous power of theirs, by a",Elementary Forms
41360,sort of mystic participation: this is the divine reason. But this,Elementary Forms
41360,hypothesis has at least the one grave disadvantage of being deprived of,Elementary Forms
41360,all experimental control; thus it does not satisfy the conditions,Elementary Forms
41360,"demanded of a scientific hypothesis. More than that, the categories of",Elementary Forms
41360,"human thought are never fixed in any one definite form; they are made,",Elementary Forms
41360,unmade and remade incessantly; they change with places and times. On the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, the divine reason is immutable. How can this immutability",Elementary Forms
41360,give rise to this incessant variability?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Such are the two conceptions that have been pitted against each other,Elementary Forms
41360,"for centuries; and if this debate seems to be eternal, it is because the",Elementary Forms
41360,arguments given are really about equivalent. If reason is only a form of,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual experience, it no longer exists. On the other hand, if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"powers which it has are recognized but not accounted for, it seems to be",Elementary Forms
41360,set outside the confines of nature and science. In the face of these two,Elementary Forms
41360,opposed objections the mind remains uncertain. But if the social origin,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the categories is admitted, a new attitude becomes possible, which we",Elementary Forms
41360,believe will enable us to escape both of the opposed difficulties.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The fundamental proposition of the apriorist theory is that knowledge is,Elementary Forms
41360,"made up of two sorts of elements, which cannot be reduced into one",Elementary Forms
41360,"another, and which are like two distinct layers superimposed one upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"the other.[16] Our hypothesis keeps this principle intact. In fact, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"knowledge which is called empirical, the only knowledge of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"theorists of empiricism have made use in constructing the reason, is",Elementary Forms
41360,that which is brought into our minds by the direct action of objects. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is composed of individual states which are completely explained[17] by,Elementary Forms
41360,"the psychical nature of the individual. If, on the other hand, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"categories are, as we believe they are, essentially collective",Elementary Forms
41360,"representations, before all else, they should show the mental states of",Elementary Forms
41360,the group; they should depend upon the way in which this is founded and,Elementary Forms
41360,"organized, upon its morphology, upon its religious, moral and economic",Elementary Forms
41360,"institutions, etc. So between these two sorts of representations there",Elementary Forms
41360,is all the difference which exists between the individual and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"social, and one can no more derive the second from the first than he can",Elementary Forms
41360,"deduce society from the individual, the whole from the part, the complex",Elementary Forms
41360,from the simple.[18] Society is a reality _sui generis_; it has its own,Elementary Forms
41360,"peculiar characteristics, which are not found elsewhere and which are",Elementary Forms
41360,not met with again in the same form in all the rest of the universe. The,Elementary Forms
41360,representations which express it have a wholly different contents from,Elementary Forms
41360,purely individual ones and we may rest assured in advance that the first,Elementary Forms
41360,add something to the second.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Even the manner in which the two are formed results in differentiating,Elementary Forms
41360,them. Collective representations are the result of an immense,Elementary Forms
41360,"co-operation, which stretches out not only into space but into time as",Elementary Forms
41360,"well; to make them, a multitude of minds have associated, united and",Elementary Forms
41360,"combined their ideas and sentiments; for them, long generations have",Elementary Forms
41360,accumulated their experience and their knowledge. A special intellectual,Elementary Forms
41360,activity is therefore concentrated in them which is infinitely richer,Elementary Forms
41360,and complexer than that of the individual. From that one can understand,Elementary Forms
41360,how the reason has been able to go beyond the limits of empirical,Elementary Forms
41360,knowledge. It does not owe this to any vague mysterious virtue but,Elementary Forms
41360,"simply to the fact that according to the well-known formula, man is",Elementary Forms
41360,double. There are two beings in him: an individual being which has its,Elementary Forms
41360,foundation in the organism and the circle of whose activities is,Elementary Forms
41360,"therefore strictly limited, and a social being which represents the",Elementary Forms
41360,highest reality in the intellectual and moral order that we can know by,Elementary Forms
41360,observation--I mean society. This duality of our nature has as its,Elementary Forms
41360,"consequence in the practical order, the irreducibility of a moral ideal",Elementary Forms
41360,"to a utilitarian motive, and in the order of thought, the irreducibility",Elementary Forms
41360,"of reason to individual experience. In so far as he belongs to society,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the individual transcends himself, both when he thinks and when he",Elementary Forms
41360,acts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This same social character leads to an understanding of the origin of,Elementary Forms
41360,the necessity of the categories. It is said that an idea is necessary,Elementary Forms
41360,"when it imposes itself upon the mind by some sort of virtue of its own,",Elementary Forms
41360,without being accompanied by any proof. It contains within it something,Elementary Forms
41360,which constrains the intelligence and which leads to its acceptance,Elementary Forms
41360,without preliminary examination. The apriorist postulates this singular,Elementary Forms
41360,"quality, but does not account for it; for saying that the categories are",Elementary Forms
41360,necessary because they are indispensable to the functioning of the,Elementary Forms
41360,intellect is simply repeating that they are necessary. But if they,Elementary Forms
41360,"really have the origin which we attribute to them, their ascendancy no",Elementary Forms
41360,longer has anything surprising in it. They represent the most general,Elementary Forms
41360,relations which exist between things; surpassing all our other ideas in,Elementary Forms
41360,"extension, they dominate all the details of our intellectual life. If",Elementary Forms
41360,"men did not agree upon these essential ideas at every moment, if they",Elementary Forms
41360,"did not have the same conception of time, space, cause, number, etc.,",Elementary Forms
41360,"all contact between their minds would be impossible, and with that, all",Elementary Forms
41360,life together. Thus society could not abandon the categories to the free,Elementary Forms
41360,choice of the individual without abandoning itself. If it is to live,Elementary Forms
41360,"there is not merely need of a satisfactory moral conformity, but also",Elementary Forms
41360,there is a minimum of logical conformity beyond which it cannot safely,Elementary Forms
41360,go. For this reason it uses all its authority upon its members to,Elementary Forms
41360,forestall such dissidences. Does a mind ostensibly free itself from,Elementary Forms
41360,these forms of thought? It is no longer considered a human mind in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"full sense of the word, and is treated accordingly. That is why we feel",Elementary Forms
41360,"that we are no longer completely free and that something resists, both",Elementary Forms
41360,"within and outside ourselves, when we attempt to rid ourselves of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental notions, even in our own conscience. Outside of us there is",Elementary Forms
41360,"public opinion which judges us; but more than that, since society is",Elementary Forms
41360,"also represented inside of us, it sets itself against these",Elementary Forms
41360,"revolutionary fancies, even inside of ourselves; we have the feeling",Elementary Forms
41360,that we cannot abandon them if our whole thought is not to cease being,Elementary Forms
41360,really human. This seems to be the origin of the exceptional authority,Elementary Forms
41360,which is inherent in the reason and which makes us accept its,Elementary Forms
41360,"suggestions with confidence. It is the very authority of society,[19]",Elementary Forms
41360,transferring itself to a certain manner of thought which is the,Elementary Forms
41360,indispensable condition of all common action. The necessity with which,Elementary Forms
41360,the categories are imposed upon us is not the effect of simple habits,Elementary Forms
41360,whose yoke we could easily throw off with a little effort; nor is it a,Elementary Forms
41360,"physical or metaphysical necessity, since the categories change in",Elementary Forms
41360,different places and times; it is a special sort of moral necessity,Elementary Forms
41360,which is to the intellectual life what moral obligation is to the,Elementary Forms
41360,will.[20],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if the categories originally only translate social states, does it",Elementary Forms
41360,not follow that they can be applied to the rest of nature only as,Elementary Forms
41360,"metaphors? If they were made merely to express social conditions, it",Elementary Forms
41360,seems as though they could not be extended to other realms except in,Elementary Forms
41360,this sense. Thus in so far as they aid us in thinking of the physical or,Elementary Forms
41360,"biological world, they have only the value of artificial symbols, useful",Elementary Forms
41360,"practically perhaps, but having no connection with reality. Thus we come",Elementary Forms
41360,"back, by a different road, to nominalism and empiricism.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But when we interpret a sociological theory of knowledge in this way, we",Elementary Forms
41360,forget that even if society is a specific reality it is not an empire,Elementary Forms
41360,"within an empire; it is a part of nature, and indeed its highest",Elementary Forms
41360,representation. The social realm is a natural realm which differs from,Elementary Forms
41360,the others only by a greater complexity. Now it is impossible that,Elementary Forms
41360,nature should differ radically from itself in the one case and the other,Elementary Forms
41360,in regard to that which is most essential. The fundamental relations,Elementary Forms
41360,that exist between things--just that which it is the function of the,Elementary Forms
41360,categories to express--cannot be essentially dissimilar in the different,Elementary Forms
41360,"realms. If, for reasons which we shall discuss later,[21] they are more",Elementary Forms
41360,"clearly disengaged in the social world, it is nevertheless impossible",Elementary Forms
41360,"that they should not be found elsewhere, though in less pronounced",Elementary Forms
41360,forms. Society makes them more manifest but it does not have a monopoly,Elementary Forms
41360,upon them. That is why ideas which have been elaborated on the model of,Elementary Forms
41360,social things can aid us in thinking of another department of nature. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is at least true that if these ideas play the role of symbols when they,Elementary Forms
41360,"are thus turned aside from their original signification, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,well-founded symbols. If a sort of artificiality enters into them from,Elementary Forms
41360,"the mere fact that they are constructed concepts, it is an",Elementary Forms
41360,artificiality which follows nature very closely and which is constantly,Elementary Forms
41360,approaching it still more closely.[22] From the fact that the ideas of,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, space, class, cause or personality are constructed out of social",Elementary Forms
41360,"elements, it is not necessary to conclude that they are devoid of all",Elementary Forms
41360,"objective value. On the contrary, their social origin rather leads to",Elementary Forms
41360,the belief that they are not without foundation in the nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,things.[23],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus renovated, the theory of knowledge seems destined to unite the",Elementary Forms
41360,"opposing advantages of the two rival theories, without incurring their",Elementary Forms
41360,inconveniences. It keeps all the essential principles of the apriorists;,Elementary Forms
41360,but at the same time it is inspired by that positive spirit which the,Elementary Forms
41360,empiricists have striven to satisfy. It leaves the reason its specific,Elementary Forms
41360,"power, but it accounts for it and does so without leaving the world of",Elementary Forms
41360,"observable phenomena. It affirms the duality of our intellectual life,",Elementary Forms
41360,"but it explains it, and with natural causes. The categories are no",Elementary Forms
41360,"longer considered as primary and unanalysable facts, yet they keep a",Elementary Forms
41360,complexity which falsifies any analysis as ready as that with which the,Elementary Forms
41360,empiricists content themselves. They no longer appear as very simple,Elementary Forms
41360,notions which the first comer can very easily arrange from his own,Elementary Forms
41360,personal observations and which the popular imagination has unluckily,Elementary Forms
41360,"complicated, but rather they appear as priceless instruments of thought",Elementary Forms
41360,which the human groups have laboriously forged through the centuries and,Elementary Forms
41360,where they have accumulated the best of their intellectual capital.[24],Elementary Forms
41360,A complete section of the history of humanity is resumed therein. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is equivalent to saying that to succeed in understanding them and,Elementary Forms
41360,"judging them, it is necessary to resort to other means than those which",Elementary Forms
41360,have been in use up to the present. To know what these conceptions which,Elementary Forms
41360,"we have not made ourselves are really made of, it does not suffice to",Elementary Forms
41360,"interrogate our own consciousnesses; we must look outside of ourselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is history that we must observe, there is a whole science which must",Elementary Forms
41360,"be formed, a complex science which can advance but slowly and by",Elementary Forms
41360,"collective labour, and to which the present work brings some fragmentary",Elementary Forms
41360,contributions in the nature of an attempt. Without making these,Elementary Forms
41360,"questions the direct object of our study, we shall profit by all the",Elementary Forms
41360,occasions which present themselves to us of catching at their very birth,Elementary Forms

41360,DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA AND OF RELIGION[25],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If we are going to look for the most primitive and simple religion which,Elementary Forms
41360,"we can observe, it is necessary to begin by defining what is meant by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion; for without this, we would run the risk of giving the name to",Elementary Forms
41360,a system of ideas and practices which has nothing at all religious about,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, or else of leaving to one side many religious facts, without",Elementary Forms
41360,"perceiving their true nature. That this is not an imaginary danger, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"that nothing is thus sacrificed to a vain formalism of method, is well",Elementary Forms
41360,"shown by the fact that owing to his not having taken this precaution, a",Elementary Forms
41360,certain scholar to whom the science of comparative religions owes a,Elementary Forms
41360,"great deal, Professor Frazer, has not been able to recognize the",Elementary Forms
41360,profoundly religious character of the beliefs and rites which will be,Elementary Forms
41360,"studied below, where, according to our view, the initial germ of the",Elementary Forms
41360,religious life of humanity is to be found. So this is a prejudicial,Elementary Forms
41360,"question, which must be treated before all others. It is not that we",Elementary Forms
41360,dream of arriving at once at the profound characteristics which really,Elementary Forms
41360,explain religion: these can be determined only at the end of our study.,Elementary Forms
41360,"But that which is necessary and possible, is to indicate a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"number of external and easily recognizable signs, which will enable us",Elementary Forms
41360,"to recognize religious phenomena wherever they are met with, and which",Elementary Forms
41360,will deter us from confounding them with others. We shall proceed to,Elementary Forms
41360,this preliminary operation at once.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But to attain the desired results, it is necessary to begin by freeing",Elementary Forms
41360,the mind of every preconceived idea. Men have been obliged to make for,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves a notion of what religion is, long before the science of",Elementary Forms
41360,religions started its methodical comparisons. The necessities of,Elementary Forms
41360,"existence force all of us, believers and non-believers, to represent in",Elementary Forms
41360,"some way these things in the midst of which we live, upon which we must",Elementary Forms
41360,"pass judgment constantly, and which we must take into account in all our",Elementary Forms
41360,"conduct. However, since these preconceived ideas are formed without any",Elementary Forms
41360,"method, according to the circumstances and chances of life, they have no",Elementary Forms
41360,"right to any credit whatsoever, and must be rigorously set aside in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"examination which is to follow. It is not from our prejudices, passions",Elementary Forms
41360,or habits that we should demand the elements of the definition which we,Elementary Forms
41360,must have; it is from the reality itself which we are going to define.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Let us set ourselves before this reality. Leaving aside all conceptions,Elementary Forms
41360,"of religion in general, let us consider the various religions in their",Elementary Forms
41360,"concrete reality, and attempt to disengage that which they have in",Elementary Forms
41360,common; for religion cannot be defined except by the characteristics,Elementary Forms
41360,"which are found wherever religion itself is found. In this comparison,",Elementary Forms
41360,"then, we shall make use of all the religious systems which we can know,",Elementary Forms
41360,"those of the present and those of the past, the most primitive and",Elementary Forms
41360,simple as well as the most recent and refined; for we have neither the,Elementary Forms
41360,right nor the logical means of excluding some and retaining others. For,Elementary Forms
41360,those who regard religion as only a natural manifestation of human,Elementary Forms
41360,"activity, all religions, without any exception whatsoever, are",Elementary Forms
41360,"instructive; for all, after their manner, express man, and thus can aid",Elementary Forms
41360,"us in better understanding this aspect of our nature. Also, we have seen",Elementary Forms
41360,how far it is from being the best way of studying religion to consider,Elementary Forms
41360,by preference the forms which it presents among the most civilized,Elementary Forms
41360,peoples.[26],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But to aid the mind in freeing itself from these usual conceptions,Elementary Forms
41360,"which, owing to their prestige, might prevent it from seeing things as",Elementary Forms
41360,"they really are, it is fitting to examine some of the most current of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the definitions in which these prejudices are commonly expressed, before",Elementary Forms
41360,taking up the question on our own account.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One idea which generally passes as characteristic of all that is,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious, is that of the supernatural. By this is understood all sorts",Elementary Forms
41360,of things which surpass the limits of our knowledge; the supernatural,Elementary Forms
41360,"is the world of the mysterious, of the unknowable, of the",Elementary Forms
41360,un-understandable. Thus religion would be a sort of speculation upon all,Elementary Forms
41360,"that which evades science or distinct thought in general. ""Religions",Elementary Forms
41360,"diametrically opposed in their overt dogmas,"" said Spencer, ""are",Elementary Forms
41360,perfectly at one in the tacit conviction that the existence of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"world, with all it contains and all which surrounds it, is a mystery",Elementary Forms
41360,"calling for an explanation""; he thus makes them consist essentially in",Elementary Forms
41360,"""the belief in the omnipresence of something which is inscrutable.""[27]",Elementary Forms
41360,"In the same manner, Max Mueller sees in religion ""a struggle to conceive",Elementary Forms
41360,"the inconceivable, to utter the unutterable, a longing after the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Infinite.""[28]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is certain that the sentiment of mystery has not been without a,Elementary Forms
41360,"considerable importance in certain religions, notably in Christianity.",Elementary Forms
41360,It must also be said that the importance of this sentiment has varied,Elementary Forms
41360,remarkably at different moments in the history of Christianity. There,Elementary Forms
41360,"are periods when this notion passes to an inferior place, and is even",Elementary Forms
41360,"effaced. For example, for the Christians of the seventeenth century,",Elementary Forms
41360,dogma had nothing disturbing for the reason; faith reconciled itself,Elementary Forms
41360,"easily with science and philosophy, and the thinkers, such as Pascal,",Elementary Forms
41360,"who really felt that there is something profoundly obscure in things,",Elementary Forms
41360,were so little in harmony with their age that they remained,Elementary Forms
41360,misunderstood by their contemporaries.[29] It would appear somewhat,Elementary Forms
41360,"hasty, therefore, to make an idea subject to parallel eclipses, the",Elementary Forms
41360,essential element of even the Christian religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In all events, it is certain that this idea does not appear until late",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the history of religions; it is completely foreign, not only to those",Elementary Forms
41360,"peoples who are called primitive, but also to all others who have not",Elementary Forms
41360,attained a considerable degree of intellectual culture. When we see them,Elementary Forms
41360,"attribute extraordinary virtues to insignificant objects, and people the",Elementary Forms
41360,"universe with singular principles, made up of the most diverse elements",Elementary Forms
41360,"and endowed with a sort of ubiquity which is hardly representable, we",Elementary Forms
41360,are undoubtedly prone to find an air of mystery in these conceptions. It,Elementary Forms
41360,seems to us that these men would have been willing to resign themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,"to these ideas, so disturbing for our modern reason, only because of",Elementary Forms
41360,"their inability to find others which were more rational. But, as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter of fact, these explanations which surprise us so much, appear to",Elementary Forms
41360,the primitive man as the simplest in the world. He does not regard them,Elementary Forms
41360,as a sort of _ultima ratio_ to which the intellect resigns itself only,Elementary Forms
41360,"in despair of others, but rather as the most obvious manner of",Elementary Forms
41360,representing and understanding what he sees about him. For him there is,Elementary Forms
41360,nothing strange in the fact that by a mere word or gesture one is able,Elementary Forms
41360,"to command the elements, retard or precipitate the motion of the stars,",Elementary Forms
41360,"bring rain or cause it to cease, etc. The rites which he employs to",Elementary Forms
41360,assure the fertility of the soil or the fecundity of the animal species,Elementary Forms
41360,on which he is nourished do not appear more irrational to his eyes than,Elementary Forms
41360,"the technical processes of which our agriculturists make use, for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same object, do to ours. The powers which he puts into play by these",Elementary Forms
41360,diverse means do not seem to him to have anything especially mysterious,Elementary Forms
41360,about them. Undoubtedly these forces are different from those which the,Elementary Forms
41360,"modern scientist thinks of, and whose use he teaches us; they have a",Elementary Forms
41360,"different way of acting, and do not allow themselves to be directed in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same manner; but for those who believe in them, they are no more",Elementary Forms
41360,unintelligible than are gravitation and electricity for the physicist of,Elementary Forms
41360,"to-day. Moreover, we shall see, in the course of this work, that the",Elementary Forms
41360,idea of physical forces is very probably derived from that of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,forces; then there cannot exist between the two the abyss which,Elementary Forms
41360,separates the rational from the irrational. Even the fact that religious,Elementary Forms
41360,forces are frequently conceived under the form of spiritual beings or,Elementary Forms
41360,"conscious wills, is no proof of their irrationality. The reason has no",Elementary Forms
41360,repugnance _a priori_ to admitting that the so-called inanimate bodies,Elementary Forms
41360,"should be directed by intelligences, just as the human body is, though",Elementary Forms
41360,contemporary science accommodates itself with difficulty to this,Elementary Forms
41360,hypothesis. When Leibniz proposed to conceive the external world as an,Elementary Forms
41360,"immense society of minds, between which there were, and could be, only",Elementary Forms
41360,"spiritual relations, he thought he was working as a rationalist, and saw",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing in this universal animism which could be offensive to the,Elementary Forms
41360,intellect.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the idea of the supernatural, as we understand it, dates only",Elementary Forms
41360,"from to-day; in fact, it presupposes the contrary idea, of which it is",Elementary Forms
41360,the negation; but this idea is not at all primitive. In order to say,Elementary Forms
41360,"that certain things are supernatural, it is necessary to have the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiment that a _natural order of things_ exists, that is to say, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"the phenomena of the universe are bound together by necessary relations,",Elementary Forms
41360,"called laws. When this principle has once been admitted, all that is",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary to these laws must necessarily appear to be outside of nature,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and consequently, of reason; for what is natural in this sense of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"word, is also rational, these necessary relations only expressing the",Elementary Forms
41360,manner in which things are logically related. But this idea of universal,Elementary Forms
41360,determinism is of recent origin; even the greatest thinkers of classical,Elementary Forms
41360,antiquity never succeeded in becoming fully conscious of it. It is a,Elementary Forms
41360,conquest of the positive sciences; it is the postulate upon which they,Elementary Forms
41360,repose and which they have proved by their progress. Now as long as this,Elementary Forms
41360,"was lacking or insufficiently established, the most marvellous events",Elementary Forms
41360,contained nothing which did not appear perfectly conceivable. So long as,Elementary Forms
41360,men did not know the immutability and the inflexibility of the order of,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, and so long as they saw there the work of contingent wills, they",Elementary Forms
41360,found it natural that either these wills or others could modify them,Elementary Forms
41360,arbitrarily. That is why the miraculous interventions which the ancients,Elementary Forms
41360,attributed to their gods were not to their eyes miracles in the modern,Elementary Forms
41360,"acceptation of the term. For them, they were beautiful, rare or terrible",Elementary Forms
41360,"spectacles, or causes of surprise and marvel ([Greek: thaumata],",Elementary Forms
41360,"_mirabilia_, _miracula_); but they never saw in them glimpses of a",Elementary Forms
41360,mysterious world into which the reason cannot penetrate.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We can understand this mentality the better since it has not yet,Elementary Forms
41360,completely disappeared from our midst. If the principle of determinism,Elementary Forms
41360,"is solidly established to-day in the physical and natural sciences, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is only a century ago that it was first introduced into the social,Elementary Forms
41360,"sciences, and its authority there is still contested. There are only a",Elementary Forms
41360,small number of minds which are strongly penetrated with this idea that,Elementary Forms
41360,societies are subject to natural laws and form a kingdom of nature. It,Elementary Forms
41360,follows that veritable miracles are believed to be possible there. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"admitted, for example, that a legislator can create an institution out",Elementary Forms
41360,"of nothing by a mere injunction of its will, or transform one social",Elementary Forms
41360,"system into another, just as the believers in so many religions have",Elementary Forms
41360,"held that the divine will created the world out of nothing, or can",Elementary Forms
41360,arbitrarily transmute one thing into another. As far as social facts are,Elementary Forms
41360,"concerned, we still have the mentality of primitives. However, if so",Elementary Forms
41360,many of our contemporaries still retain this antiquated conception for,Elementary Forms
41360,"sociological affairs, it is not because the life of societies appears",Elementary Forms
41360,"obscure and mysterious to them; on the contrary, if they are so easily",Elementary Forms
41360,"contented with these explanations, and if they are so obstinate in their",Elementary Forms
41360,"illusions which experience constantly belies, it is because social",Elementary Forms
41360,events seem to them the clearest thing in the world; it is because they,Elementary Forms
41360,have not yet realized their real obscurity; it is because they have not,Elementary Forms
41360,yet recognized the necessity of resorting to the laborious methods of,Elementary Forms
41360,the natural sciences to gradually scatter the darkness. The same state,Elementary Forms
41360,of mind is found at the root of many religious beliefs which surprise us,Elementary Forms
41360,by their pseudo-simplicity. It is science and not religion which has,Elementary Forms
41360,taught men that things are complex and difficult to understand.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But the human mind, says Jevons,[30] has no need of a properly",Elementary Forms
41360,"scientific culture to notice that determined sequences, or a constant",Elementary Forms
41360,"order of succession, exist between facts, or to observe, on the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, that this order is frequently upset. It sometimes happens that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sun is suddenly eclipsed, that rain fails at the time when it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"expected, that the moon is slow to reappear after its periodical",Elementary Forms
41360,"disappearance, etc. Since these events are outside the ordinary course",Elementary Forms
41360,"of affairs, they are attributed to extraordinary exceptional causes,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that is to say, in fine, to extra-natural causes. It is under this form",Elementary Forms
41360,"that the idea of the supernatural is born at the very outset of history,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and from this moment, according to this author, religious thought finds",Elementary Forms
41360,itself provided with its proper subject.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But in the first place, the supernatural cannot be reduced to the",Elementary Forms
41360,unforeseen. The new is a part of nature just as well as its contrary. If,Elementary Forms
41360,"we state that in general, phenomena succeed one another in a determined",Elementary Forms
41360,"order, we observe equally well that this order is only approximative,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is not always precisely the same, and that it has all kinds of",Elementary Forms
41360,"exceptions. If we have ever so little experience, we are accustomed to",Elementary Forms
41360,"seeing our expectations fail, and these deceptions return too often to",Elementary Forms
41360,appear extraordinary to us. A certain contingency is taught by,Elementary Forms
41360,experience just as well as a certain uniformity; then we have no reason,Elementary Forms
41360,for assigning the one to causes and forces entirely different from those,Elementary Forms
41360,upon which the other depends. In order to arrive at the idea of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"supernatural, it is not enough, therefore, to be witnesses to unexpected",Elementary Forms
41360,"events; it is also necessary that these be conceived as impossible, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, irreconcilable with an order which, rightly or wrongly,",Elementary Forms
41360,appears to us to be implied in the nature of things. Now this idea of a,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary order has been constructed little by little by the positive,Elementary Forms
41360,"sciences, and consequently the contrary notion could not have existed",Elementary Forms
41360,before them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, in whatever manner men have represented the novelties and",Elementary Forms
41360,"contingencies revealed by experience, there is nothing in these",Elementary Forms
41360,representations which could serve to characterize religion. For,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious conceptions have as their object, before everything else, to",Elementary Forms
41360,"express and explain, not that which is exceptional and abnormal in",Elementary Forms
41360,"things, but, on the contrary, that which is constant and regular. Very",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently, the gods serve less to account for the monstrosities,",Elementary Forms
41360,"fantasies and anomalies than for the regular march of the universe, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the movement of the stars, the rhythm of the seasons, the annual growth",Elementary Forms
41360,"of vegetation, the perpetuation of species, etc. It is far from being",Elementary Forms
41360,"true, then, that the notion of the religions coincides with that of the",Elementary Forms
41360,extraordinary or the unforeseen. Jevons replies that this conception of,Elementary Forms
41360,religious forces is not primitive. Men commenced by imagining them to,Elementary Forms
41360,"account for disorders and accidents, and it was only afterwards that",Elementary Forms
41360,they began to utilize them in explaining the uniformities of,Elementary Forms
41360,nature.[31] But it is not clear what could have led men to attribute,Elementary Forms
41360,"such manifestly contradictory functions to them. More than that, the",Elementary Forms
41360,hypothesis according to which sacred beings were at first restricted to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the negative function of disturbers is quite arbitrary. In fact, we",Elementary Forms
41360,"shall see that, even with the most simple religions we know, their",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential task is to maintain, in a positive manner, the normal course",Elementary Forms
41360,of life.[32],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So the idea of mystery is not of primitive origin. It was not given to,Elementary Forms
41360,"man; it is man who has forged it, with his own hands, along with the",Elementary Forms
41360,contrary idea. This is why it has a place only in a very small number of,Elementary Forms
41360,advanced religions. It is impossible to make it the characteristic mark,Elementary Forms
41360,of religious phenomena without excluding from the definition the,Elementary Forms
41360,majority of the facts to be defined.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Another idea by which the attempt to define religion is often made, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"that of divinity. ""Religion,"" says M. Reville,[33] ""is the determination",Elementary Forms
41360,of human life by the sentiment of a bond uniting the human mind to that,Elementary Forms
41360,"mysterious mind whose domination of the world and itself it recognizes,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and to whom it delights in feeling itself united."" It is certain that if",Elementary Forms
41360,"the word divinity is taken in a precise and narrow sense, this",Elementary Forms
41360,definition leaves aside a multitude of obviously religious facts. The,Elementary Forms
41360,souls of the dead and the spirits of all ranks and classes with which,Elementary Forms
41360,the religious imagination of so many different peoples has populated,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature, are always the object of rites and sometimes even of a regular",Elementary Forms
41360,cult; yet they are not gods in the proper sense of the term. But in,Elementary Forms
41360,"order that the definition may embrace them, it is enough to substitute",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the term ""gods"" the more comprehensive one of ""spiritual beings.""",Elementary Forms
41360,"This is what Tylor does. ""The first requisite in a systematic study of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the religions of the lower races,"" he says, ""is to lay down a",Elementary Forms
41360,rudimentary definition of religion. By requiring in this definition the,Elementary Forms
41360,"belief in a supreme deity ..., no doubt many tribes may be excluded from",Elementary Forms
41360,the category of religious. But such narrow definition has the fault of,Elementary Forms
41360,identifying religion rather with particular developments.... It seems,Elementary Forms
41360,"best ... simply to claim as a minimum definition of Religion, the belief",Elementary Forms
41360,"in Spiritual Beings.""[34] By spiritual beings must be understood",Elementary Forms
41360,conscious subjects gifted with powers superior to those possessed by,Elementary Forms
41360,"common men; this qualification is found in the souls of the dead,",Elementary Forms
41360,geniuses or demons as well as in divinities properly so-called. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"important, therefore, to give our attention at once to the particular",Elementary Forms
41360,conception of religion which is implied in this definition. The,Elementary Forms
41360,relations which we can have with beings of this sort are determined by,Elementary Forms
41360,the nature attributed to them. They are conscious beings; then we can,Elementary Forms
41360,act upon them only in the same way that we act upon consciousnesses in,Elementary Forms
41360,"general, that is to say, by psychological processes, attempting to",Elementary Forms
41360,"convince them or move them, either with the aid of words (invocations,",Elementary Forms
41360,"prayers), or by offerings and sacrifices. And since the object of",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is to regulate our relations with these special beings, there",Elementary Forms
41360,"can be no religion except where there are prayers, sacrifices,",Elementary Forms
41360,"propitiatory rites, etc. Thus we have a very simple criterium which",Elementary Forms
41360,permits us to distinguish that which is religious from that which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not. It is to this criterium that Frazer,[35] and with him numerous",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnographers,[36] systematically makes reference.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But howsoever evident this definition may appear, thanks to the mental",Elementary Forms
41360,"habits which we owe to our religious education, there are many facts to",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it is not applicable, but which appertain to the field of religion",Elementary Forms
41360,nevertheless.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, there are great religions from which the idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,"gods and spirits is absent, or at least, where it plays only a secondary",Elementary Forms
41360,"and minor role. This is the case with Buddhism. Buddhism, says Burnouf,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""sets itself in opposition to Brahmanism as a moral system without god",Elementary Forms
41360,"and an atheism without Nature.""[37] ""As it recognizes not a god upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"whom man depends,"" says Barth, ""its doctrine is absolutely",Elementary Forms
41360,"atheistic,""[38] while Oldenberg, in his turn, calls it ""a faith without",Elementary Forms
41360,"a god.""[39] In fact, all that is essential to Buddhism is found in the",Elementary Forms
41360,four propositions which the faithful call the four noble truths.[40] The,Elementary Forms
41360,first states the existence of suffering as the accompaniment to the,Elementary Forms
41360,perpetual change of things; the second shows desire to be the cause of,Elementary Forms
41360,suffering; the third makes the suppression of desire the only means of,Elementary Forms
41360,suppressing sorrow; the fourth enumerates the three stages through which,Elementary Forms
41360,"one must pass to attain this suppression: they are uprightness,",Elementary Forms
41360,"meditation, and finally wisdom, the full possession of the doctrine.",Elementary Forms
41360,"These three stages once traversed, one arrives at the end of the road,",Elementary Forms
41360,"at the deliverance, at salvation by the Nirvana.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now in none of these principles is there question of a divinity. The,Elementary Forms
41360,Buddhist is not interested in knowing whence came the world in which he,Elementary Forms
41360,"lives and suffers; he takes it as a given fact,[41] and his whole",Elementary Forms
41360,"concern is to escape it. On the other hand, in this work of salvation,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he can count only upon himself; ""he has no god to thank, as he had",Elementary Forms
41360,"previously no god to invoke during his struggle.""[42] Instead of",Elementary Forms
41360,"praying, in the ordinary sense of the term, instead of turning towards a",Elementary Forms
41360,"superior being and imploring his assistance, he relies upon himself and",Elementary Forms
41360,"meditates. This is not saying ""that he absolutely denies the existence",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the beings called Indra, Agni and Varuna;[43] but he believes that he",Elementary Forms
41360,"owes them nothing and that he has nothing to do with them,"" for their",Elementary Forms
41360,"power can only extend over the goods of this world, which are without",Elementary Forms
41360,"value for him. Then he is an atheist, in the sense that he does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"concern himself with the question whether gods exist or not. Besides,",Elementary Forms
41360,"even if they should exist, and with whatever powers they might be armed,",Elementary Forms
41360,the saint or the emancipated man regards himself superior to them; for,Elementary Forms
41360,that which causes the dignity of beings is not the extent of the action,Elementary Forms
41360,"they exercise over things, but merely the degree of their advancement",Elementary Forms
41360,upon the road of salvation.[44],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is true that Buddha, at least in some divisions of the Buddhist",Elementary Forms
41360,"Church, has sometimes been considered as a sort of god. He has his",Elementary Forms
41360,"temples; he is the object of a cult, which, by the way, is a very simple",Elementary Forms
41360,"one, for it is reduced essentially to the offering of flowers and the",Elementary Forms
41360,adoration of consecrated relics or images. It is scarcely more than a,Elementary Forms
41360,"commemorative cult. But more than that, this divinization of Buddha,",Elementary Forms
41360,"granting that the term is exact, is peculiar to the form known as",Elementary Forms
41360,"Northern Buddhism. ""The Buddhist of the South,"" says Kern, ""and the less",Elementary Forms
41360,"advanced of the Northern Buddhists can be said, according to data known",Elementary Forms
41360,"to-day, to speak of their founder as if he were a man.""[45] Of course,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they attribute extraordinary powers to Buddha, which are superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,those possessed by ordinary mortals; but it was a very ancient belief in,Elementary Forms
41360,"India, and one that is also very general in a host of different",Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, that a great saint is endowed with exceptional virtues;[46]",Elementary Forms
41360,"yet a saint is not a god, any more than a priest or magician is, in",Elementary Forms
41360,spite of the superhuman faculties frequently attributed to them. On the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, according to the most authorized scholars, all this theism",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the complicated mythology which generally accompanies it, are only",Elementary Forms
41360,"derived and deviated forms of Buddhism. At first, Buddha was only",Elementary Forms
41360,"regarded as ""the wisest of men.""[47] Burnouf says ""the conception of a",Elementary Forms
41360,Buddha who is something more than a man arrived at the highest stage of,Elementary Forms
41360,"holiness, is outside the circle of ideas which form the foundation of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the simple Sutras"";[48] and the same author adds elsewhere that ""his",Elementary Forms
41360,humanity is a fact so incontestably recognized by all that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"myth-makers, to whom miracles cost so little, have never even had the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of making a god out of him since his death.""[49] So we may well ask",Elementary Forms
41360,if he has ever really divested himself completely of all human,Elementary Forms
41360,"character, and if we have a right to make him into a god completely;[50]",Elementary Forms
41360,"in any case, it would have to be a god of a very particular character",Elementary Forms
41360,and one whose role in no way resembles that of other divine,Elementary Forms
41360,"personalities. For a god is before all else a living being, with whom",Elementary Forms
41360,"man should reckon, and upon whom he may count; but Buddha is dead, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"has entered into the Nirvana, and he can no longer influence the march",Elementary Forms
41360,of human events.[51],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, whatever one may think of the divinity of Buddha, it remains a",Elementary Forms
41360,fact that this is a conception wholly outside the essential part of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Buddhism. Buddhism consists primarily in the idea of salvation, and",Elementary Forms
41360,salvation supposes only that one know the good doctrine and practise it.,Elementary Forms
41360,"To be sure, this could never have been known if Buddha had not come to",Elementary Forms
41360,"reveal it; but when this revelation had once been made, the work of",Elementary Forms
41360,Buddha was accomplished. From that moment he ceased to be a factor,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to the religious life. The practice of the four holy truths,Elementary Forms
41360,"would be possible, even if the memory of him who revealed them were",Elementary Forms
41360,completely obliterated.[52] It is quite another matter with,Elementary Forms
41360,"Christianity, which is inconceivable without the ever-present idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Christ and his ever-practised cult; for it is by the ever-living Christ,",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrificed each day, that the community of believers continues to",Elementary Forms
41360,communicate with the supreme source of the spiritual life.[53],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,All that precedes can be applied equally well to another great religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"of India, Jainism. The two doctrines have nearly the same conception of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the world and of life. ""Like the Buddhists,"" says Barth, ""the Jainas are",Elementary Forms
41360,atheists. They admit of no creator; the world is eternal; they,Elementary Forms
41360,explicitly deny the possibility of a perfect being from the beginning.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The Jina became perfect; he was not always so.""",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Just as the Buddhists in the north, the Jainists, or at least certain of",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, have come back to a sort of deism; in the inscriptions of Dekhan",Elementary Forms
41360,"there is mention of a _Jinapati_, a sort of supreme Jina, who is called",Elementary Forms
41360,"the primary creator; but such language, says the same author, is ""in",Elementary Forms
41360,contradiction to the most explicit declarations extracted from their,Elementary Forms
41360,"most authorized writings.""[54]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, if this indifference for the divine is developed to such a",Elementary Forms
41360,"point in Buddhism and Jainism, it is because its germ existed already in",Elementary Forms
41360,the Brahmanism from which the two were derived. In certain of its forms,Elementary Forms
41360,"at least, Brahmic speculation ended in ""a frankly materialistic and",Elementary Forms
41360,"atheistic interpretation of the universe.""[55] In time, the numerous",Elementary Forms
41360,"divinities which the people of India had originally learned to adore,",Elementary Forms
41360,"came to merge themselves into a sort of principal deity, impersonal and",Elementary Forms
41360,"abstract, the essence of all that exists. This supreme reality, which no",Elementary Forms
41360,"longer has anything of a divine personality about it, is contained",Elementary Forms
41360,"within man himself, or rather, man is but one with it, for nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,"exists apart from it. To find it, and unite himself to it, one does not",Elementary Forms
41360,have to search some external support outside himself; it is enough to,Elementary Forms
41360,"concentrate upon himself and meditate. ""If in Buddhism,"" says Oldenberg,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""the proud attempt be made to conceive a deliverance in which man",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself delivers himself, to create a faith without a god, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,Brahmanical speculation which has prepared the way for this thought. It,Elementary Forms
41360,thrusts back the idea of a god step by step; the forms of the old gods,Elementary Forms
41360,"have faded away, and besides the Brahma, which is enthroned in its",Elementary Forms
41360,"everlasting quietude, highly exalted above the destinies of the human",Elementary Forms
41360,"world, there is left remaining, as the sole really active person in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"great work of deliverance, man himself.""[56] Here, then, we find a",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable portion of religious evolution which has consisted in the,Elementary Forms
41360,progressive recoil of the idea of a spiritual being from that of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"deity. Here are great religions where invocations, propitiations,",Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifices and prayers properly so-called are far from holding a,Elementary Forms
41360,"preponderating place, and which consequently do not present that",Elementary Forms
41360,distinctive sign by which some claim to recognize those manifestations,Elementary Forms
41360,which are properly called religious.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But even within deistic religions there are many rites which are,Elementary Forms
41360,completely independent of all idea of gods or spiritual beings. In the,Elementary Forms
41360,"first place, there are a multitude of interdictions. For example, the",Elementary Forms
41360,Bible orders that a woman live isolated during a determined period each,Elementary Forms
41360,month;[57] a similar isolation is obligatory during the lying-in at,Elementary Forms
41360,"child-birth;[58] it is forbidden to hitch an ass and a horse together,",Elementary Forms
41360,or to wear a garment in which the hemp is mixed with flax;[59] but it is,Elementary Forms
41360,impossible to see the part which belief in Jahveh can have played in,Elementary Forms
41360,"these interdictions, for he is wholly absent from all the relations thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden, and could not be interested in them. As much can be said for",Elementary Forms
41360,the majority of the dietetic regulations. These prohibitions are not,Elementary Forms
41360,"peculiar to the Hebrews, but they are found under diverse forms, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"with substantially the same character, in innumerable religions.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is true that these rites are purely negative, but they do not cease",Elementary Forms
41360,being religious for that. Also there are others which demand active and,Elementary Forms
41360,"positive services of the faithful, but which are nevertheless of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same nature. They work by themselves, and their efficacy depends upon no",Elementary Forms
41360,divine power; they mechanically produce the effects which are the reason,Elementary Forms
41360,for their existence. They do not consist either in prayers or offerings,Elementary Forms
41360,addressed to a being upon whose goodwill the expected result depends;,Elementary Forms
41360,this result is obtained by the automatic operation of the ritual. Such,Elementary Forms
41360,"is notably the case with the sacrifice of the Vedic religion. ""The",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrifice exercises a direct influence upon the celestial phenomena,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"says Bergaigne;[60] it is all-powerful of itself, and without any divine",Elementary Forms
41360,"influence. It is this, for example, which broke open the doors of the",Elementary Forms
41360,cavern where the dawn was imprisoned and which made the light of day,Elementary Forms
41360,"burst forth.[61] In the same way there are special hymns which, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"their direct action, made the waters of heaven fall upon the earth, and",Elementary Forms
41360,_even in spite of the gods_.[62] The practice of certain austerities has,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same power. More than that, ""the sacrifice is so fully the origin of",Elementary Forms
41360,"things _par excellence_, that they have attributed to it not only the",Elementary Forms
41360,"origin of man, but even that of the gods.... Such a conception may well",Elementary Forms
41360,"appear strange. It is explained, however, as being one of the ultimate",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequences of the idea of the omnipotence of sacrifice.""[63] Thus, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the entire first part of his work, M. Bergaigne speaks only of",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrifices, where divinities play no role whatsoever.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nor is this fact peculiar to the Vedic religion, but is, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, quite general. In every cult there are practices which act by",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves, by a virtue which is their own, without the intervention of",Elementary Forms
41360,any god between the individual who practises the rite and the end sought,Elementary Forms
41360,"after. When, in the so-called Feast of the Tabernacles, the Jew set the",Elementary Forms
41360,"air in motion by shaking willow branches in a certain rhythm, it was to",Elementary Forms
41360,cause the wind to rise and the rain to fall; and it was believed that,Elementary Forms
41360,"the desired phenomenon would result automatically from the rite,",Elementary Forms
41360,provided it were correctly performed.[64] This is the explanation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental importance laid by nearly all cults upon the material,Elementary Forms
41360,portion of the ceremonies. This religious formalism--very probably the,Elementary Forms
41360,first form of legal formalism--comes from the fact that since the,Elementary Forms
41360,formula to be pronounced and the movements to be made contain within,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves the source of their efficacy, they would lose it if they did",Elementary Forms
41360,not conform absolutely to the type consecrated by success.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus there are rites without gods, and even rites from which gods are",Elementary Forms
41360,"derived. All religious powers do not emanate from divine personalities,",Elementary Forms
41360,and there are relations of cult which have other objects than uniting,Elementary Forms
41360,"man to a deity. Religion is more than the idea of gods or spirits, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently cannot be defined exclusively in relation to these latter.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"These definitions set aside, let us set ourselves before the problem.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"First of all, let us remark that in all these formulae it is the nature",Elementary Forms
41360,of religion as a whole that they seek to express. They proceed as if it,Elementary Forms
41360,"were a sort of indivisible entity, while, as a matter of fact, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"made up of parts; it is a more or less complex system of myths, dogmas,",Elementary Forms
41360,rites and ceremonies. Now a whole cannot be defined except in relation,Elementary Forms
41360,"to its parts. It will be more methodical, then, to try to characterize",Elementary Forms
41360,"the various elementary phenomena of which all religions are made up,",Elementary Forms
41360,before we attack the system produced by their union. This method is,Elementary Forms
41360,imposed still more forcibly by the fact that there are religious,Elementary Forms
41360,phenomena which belong to no determined religion. Such are those,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena which constitute the matter of folk-lore. In general, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"the debris of passed religions, inorganized survivals; but there are",Elementary Forms
41360,some which have been formed spontaneously under the influence of local,Elementary Forms
41360,causes. In our European countries Christianity has forced itself to,Elementary Forms
41360,absorb and assimilate them; it has given them a Christian colouring.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nevertheless, there are many which have persisted up until a recent",Elementary Forms
41360,"date, or which still exist with a relative autonomy: celebrations of May",Elementary Forms
41360,"Day, the summer solstice or the carnival, beliefs relative to genii,",Elementary Forms
41360,"local demons, etc., are cases in point. If the religious character of",Elementary Forms
41360,"these facts is now diminishing, their religious importance is",Elementary Forms
41360,nevertheless so great that they have enabled Mannhardt and his school to,Elementary Forms
41360,revive the science of religions. A definition which did not take account,Elementary Forms
41360,of them would not cover all that is religious.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Religious phenomena are naturally arranged in two fundamental,Elementary Forms
41360,"categories: beliefs and rites. The first are states of opinion, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consist in representations; the second are determined modes of action.,Elementary Forms
41360,Between these two classes of facts there is all the difference which,Elementary Forms
41360,separates thought from action.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The rites can be defined and distinguished from other human practices,",Elementary Forms
41360,"moral practices, for example, only by the special nature of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"object. A moral rule prescribes certain manners of acting to us, just as",Elementary Forms
41360,"a rite does, but which are addressed to a different class of objects. So",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is the object of the rite which must be characterized, if we are to",Elementary Forms
41360,characterize the rite itself. Now it is in the beliefs that the special,Elementary Forms
41360,nature of this object is expressed. It is possible to define the rite,Elementary Forms
41360,only after we have defined the belief.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"All known religious beliefs, whether simple or complex, present one",Elementary Forms
41360,common characteristic: they presuppose a classification of all the,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, real and ideal, of which men think, into two classes or opposed",Elementary Forms
41360,"groups, generally designated by two distinct terms which are translated",Elementary Forms
41360,"well enough by the words _profane_ and _sacred_ (_profane_, _sacre_).",Elementary Forms
41360,"This division of the world into two domains, the one containing all that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is sacred, the other all that is profane, is the distinctive trait of",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious thought; the beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are either",Elementary Forms
41360,representations or systems of representations which express the nature,Elementary Forms
41360,"of sacred things, the virtues and powers which are attributed to them,",Elementary Forms
41360,or their relations with each other and with profane things. But by,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred things one must not understand simply those personal beings which,Elementary Forms
41360,"are called gods or spirits; a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece",Elementary Forms
41360,"of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred. A rite can have",Elementary Forms
41360,"this character; in fact, the rite does not exist which does not have it",Elementary Forms
41360,"to a certain degree. There are words, expressions and formulae which can",Elementary Forms
41360,be pronounced only by the mouths of consecrated persons; there are,Elementary Forms
41360,gestures and movements which everybody cannot perform. If the Vedic,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrifice has had such an efficacy that, according to mythology, it was",Elementary Forms
41360,"the creator of the gods, and not merely a means of winning their favour,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is because it possessed a virtue comparable to that of the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred beings. The circle of sacred objects cannot be determined, then,",Elementary Forms
41360,"once for all. Its extent varies infinitely, according to the different",Elementary Forms
41360,"religions. That is how Buddhism is a religion: in default of gods, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the four noble truths and",Elementary Forms
41360,the practices derived from them.[65],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Up to the present we have confined ourselves to enumerating a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,number of sacred things as examples: we must now show by what general,Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics they are to be distinguished from profane things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"One might be tempted, first of all, to define them by the place they are",Elementary Forms
41360,generally assigned in the hierarchy of things. They are naturally,Elementary Forms
41360,"considered superior in dignity and power to profane things, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"particularly to man, when he is only a man and has nothing sacred about",Elementary Forms
41360,him. One thinks of himself as occupying an inferior and dependent,Elementary Forms
41360,position in relation to them; and surely this conception is not without,Elementary Forms
41360,some truth. Only there is nothing in it which is really characteristic,Elementary Forms
41360,of the sacred. It is not enough that one thing be subordinated to,Elementary Forms
41360,another for the second to be sacred in regard to the first. Slaves are,Elementary Forms
41360,"inferior to their masters, subjects to their king, soldiers to their",Elementary Forms
41360,"leaders, the miser to his gold, the man ambitious for power to the hands",Elementary Forms
41360,which keep it from him; but if it is sometimes said of a man that he,Elementary Forms
41360,makes a religion of those beings or things whose eminent value and,Elementary Forms
41360,"superiority to himself he thus recognizes, it is clear that in any case",Elementary Forms
41360,"the word is taken in a metaphorical sense, and that there is nothing in",Elementary Forms
41360,these relations which is really religious.[66],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"On the other hand, it must not be lost to view that there are sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"things of every degree, and that there are some in relation to which a",Elementary Forms
41360,man feels himself relatively at his ease. An amulet has a sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"character, yet the respect which it inspires is nothing exceptional.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Even before his gods, a man is not always in such a marked state of",Elementary Forms
41360,inferiority; for it very frequently happens that he exercises a,Elementary Forms
41360,veritable physical constraint upon them to obtain what he desires. He,Elementary Forms
41360,"beats the fetich with which he is not contented, but only to reconcile",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself with it again, if in the end it shows itself more docile to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"wishes of its adorer.[67] To have rain, he throws stones into the spring",Elementary Forms
41360,or sacred lake where the god of rain is thought to reside; he believes,Elementary Forms
41360,that by this means he forces him to come out and show himself.[68],Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, if it is true that man depends upon his gods, this dependence",Elementary Forms
41360,is reciprocal. The gods also have need of man; without offerings and,Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifices they would die. We shall even have occasion to show that this,Elementary Forms
41360,dependence of the gods upon their worshippers is maintained even in the,Elementary Forms
41360,most idealistic religions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if a purely hierarchic distinction is a criterium at once too,Elementary Forms
41360,"general and too imprecise, there is nothing left with which to",Elementary Forms
41360,characterize the sacred in its relation to the profane except their,Elementary Forms
41360,"heterogeneity. However, this heterogeneity is sufficient to characterize",Elementary Forms
41360,"this classification of things and to distinguish it from all others,",Elementary Forms
41360,because it is very particular: _it is absolute_. In all the history of,Elementary Forms
41360,human thought there exists no other example of two categories of things,Elementary Forms
41360,so profoundly differentiated or so radically opposed to one another. The,Elementary Forms
41360,traditional opposition of good and bad is nothing beside this; for the,Elementary Forms
41360,"good and the bad are only two opposed species of the same class, namely",Elementary Forms
41360,"morals, just as sickness and health are two different aspects of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same order of facts, life, while the sacred and the profane have always",Elementary Forms
41360,"and everywhere been conceived by the human mind as two distinct classes,",Elementary Forms
41360,as two worlds between which there is nothing in common. The forces,Elementary Forms
41360,"which play in one are not simply those which are met with in the other,",Elementary Forms
41360,but a little stronger; they are of a different sort. In different,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, this opposition has been conceived in different ways. Here,",Elementary Forms
41360,"to separate these two sorts of things, it has seemed sufficient to",Elementary Forms
41360,"localize them in different parts of the physical universe; there, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first have been put into an ideal and transcendental world, while the",Elementary Forms
41360,material world is left in full possession of the others. But howsoever,Elementary Forms
41360,"much the forms of the contrast may vary,[69] the fact of the contrast is",Elementary Forms
41360,universal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is not equivalent to saying that a being can never pass from one of,Elementary Forms
41360,these worlds into the other: but the manner in which this passage is,Elementary Forms
41360,"effected, when it does take place, puts into relief the essential",Elementary Forms
41360,"duality of the two kingdoms. In fact, it implies a veritable",Elementary Forms
41360,"metamorphosis. This is notably demonstrated by the initiation rites,",Elementary Forms
41360,such as they are practised by a multitude of peoples. This initiation is,Elementary Forms
41360,a long series of ceremonies with the object of introducing the young man,Elementary Forms
41360,"into the religious life: for the first time, he leaves the purely",Elementary Forms
41360,"profane world where he passed his first infancy, and enters into the",Elementary Forms
41360,"world of sacred things. Now this change of state is thought of, not as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"simple and regular development of pre-existent germs, but as a",Elementary Forms
41360,transformation _totius substantiae_--of the whole being. It is said that,Elementary Forms
41360,"at this moment the young man dies, that the person that he was ceases to",Elementary Forms
41360,"exist, and that another is instantly substituted for it. He is re-born",Elementary Forms
41360,under a new form. Appropriate ceremonies are felt to bring about this,Elementary Forms
41360,"death and re-birth, which are not understood in a merely symbolic sense,",Elementary Forms
41360,but are taken literally.[70] Does this not prove that between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"profane being which he was and the religious being which he becomes,",Elementary Forms
41360,there is a break of continuity?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This heterogeneity is even so complete that it frequently degenerates,Elementary Forms
41360,into a veritable antagonism. The two worlds are not only conceived of as,Elementary Forms
41360,"separate, but as even hostile and jealous rivals of each other. Since",Elementary Forms
41360,men cannot fully belong to one except on condition of leaving the other,Elementary Forms
41360,"completely, they are exhorted to withdraw themselves completely from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"profane world, in order to lead an exclusively religious life. Hence",Elementary Forms
41360,comes the monasticism which is artificially organized outside of and,Elementary Forms
41360,apart from the natural environment in which the ordinary man leads the,Elementary Forms
41360,"life of this world, in a different one, closed to the first, and nearly",Elementary Forms
41360,its contrary. Hence comes the mystic asceticism whose object is to root,Elementary Forms
41360,out from man all the attachment for the profane world that remains in,Elementary Forms
41360,"him. From that come all the forms of religious suicide, the logical",Elementary Forms
41360,working-out of this asceticism; for the only manner of fully escaping,Elementary Forms
41360,"the profane life is, after all, to forsake all life.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The opposition of these two classes manifests itself outwardly with a,Elementary Forms
41360,visible sign by which we can easily recognize this very special,Elementary Forms
41360,"classification, wherever it exists. Since the idea of the sacred is",Elementary Forms
41360,always and everywhere separated from the idea of the profane in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought of men, and since we picture a sort of logical chasm between the",Elementary Forms
41360,"two, the mind irresistibly refuses to allow the two corresponding things",Elementary Forms
41360,"to be confounded, or even to be merely put in contact with each other;",Elementary Forms
41360,"for such a promiscuity, or even too direct a contiguity, would",Elementary Forms
41360,contradict too violently the dissociation of these ideas in the mind.,Elementary Forms
41360,The sacred thing is _par excellence_ that which the profane should not,Elementary Forms
41360,"touch, and cannot touch with impunity. To be sure, this interdiction",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot go so far as to make all communication between the two worlds,Elementary Forms
41360,impossible; for if the profane could in no way enter into relations with,Elementary Forms
41360,"the sacred, this latter could be good for nothing. But, in addition to",Elementary Forms
41360,the fact that this establishment of relations is always a delicate,Elementary Forms
41360,"operation in itself, demanding great precautions and a more or less",Elementary Forms
41360,"complicated initiation,[71] it is quite impossible, unless the profane",Elementary Forms
41360,is to lose its specific characteristics and become sacred after a,Elementary Forms
41360,fashion and to a certain degree itself. The two classes cannot even,Elementary Forms
41360,approach each other and keep their own nature at the same time.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus we arrive at the first criterium of religious beliefs. Undoubtedly,Elementary Forms
41360,"there are secondary species within these two fundamental classes which,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in their turn, are more or less incompatible with each other.[72] But",Elementary Forms
41360,the real characteristic of religious phenomena is that they always,Elementary Forms
41360,"suppose a bipartite division of the whole universe, known and knowable,",Elementary Forms
41360,"into two classes which embrace all that exists, but which radically",Elementary Forms
41360,exclude each other. Sacred things are those which the interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,"protect and isolate; profane things, those to which these interdictions",Elementary Forms
41360,are applied and which must remain at a distance from the first.,Elementary Forms
41360,Religious beliefs are the representations which express the nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred things and the relations which they sustain, either with each",Elementary Forms
41360,"other or with profane things. Finally, rites are the rules of conduct",Elementary Forms
41360,which prescribe how a man should comport himself in the presence of,Elementary Forms
41360,these sacred objects.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,When a certain number of sacred things sustain relations of,Elementary Forms
41360,co-ordination or subordination with each other in such a way as to form,Elementary Forms
41360,"a system having a certain unity, but which is not comprised within any",Elementary Forms
41360,"other system of the same sort, the totality of these beliefs and their",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding rites constitutes a religion. From this definition it is,Elementary Forms
41360,seen that a religion is not necessarily contained within one sole and,Elementary Forms
41360,"single idea, and does not proceed from one unique principle which,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though varying according to the circumstances under which it is applied,",Elementary Forms
41360,is nevertheless at bottom always the same: it is rather a whole made up,Elementary Forms
41360,of distinct and relatively individualized parts. Each homogeneous group,Elementary Forms
41360,"of sacred things, or even each sacred thing of some importance,",Elementary Forms
41360,constitutes a centre of organization about which gravitate a group of,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs and rites, or a particular cult; there is no religion, howsoever",Elementary Forms
41360,"unified it may be, which does not recognize a plurality of sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"things. Even Christianity, at least in its Catholic form, admits, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"addition to the divine personality which, incidentally, is triple as",Elementary Forms
41360,"well as one, the Virgin, angels, saints, souls of the dead, etc. Thus a",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion cannot be reduced to one single cult generally, but father",Elementary Forms
41360,"consists in a system of cults, each endowed with a certain autonomy.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, this autonomy is variable. Sometimes they are arranged in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"hierarchy, and subordinated to some predominating cult, into which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are finally absorbed; but sometimes, also, they are merely rearranged",Elementary Forms
41360,and united. The religion which we are going to study will furnish us,Elementary Forms
41360,with an example of just this latter sort of organization.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,At the same time we find the explanation of how there can be groups of,Elementary Forms
41360,religious phenomena which do not belong to any special religion; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"because they have not been, or are no longer, a part of any religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"system. If, for some special reason, one of the cults of which we just",Elementary Forms
41360,spoke happens to be maintained while the group of which it was a part,Elementary Forms
41360,"disappears, it survives only in a disintegrated condition. That is what",Elementary Forms
41360,has happened to many agrarian cults which have survived themselves as,Elementary Forms
41360,"folk-lore. In certain cases, it is not even a cult, but a simple",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremony or particular rite which persists in this way.[73],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Although this definition is only preliminary, it permits us to see in",Elementary Forms
41360,what terms the problem which necessarily dominates the science of,Elementary Forms
41360,religions should be stated. When we believed that sacred beings could be,Elementary Forms
41360,distinguished from others merely by the greater intensity of the powers,Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to them, the question of how men came to imagine them was",Elementary Forms
41360,"sufficiently simple: it was enough to demand which forces had, because",Elementary Forms
41360,"of their exceptional energy, been able to strike the human imagination",Elementary Forms
41360,"forcefully enough to inspire religious sentiments. But if, as we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"sought to establish, sacred things differ in nature from profane things,",Elementary Forms
41360,"if they have a wholly different essence, then the problem is more",Elementary Forms
41360,complex. For we must first of all ask what has been able to lead men to,Elementary Forms
41360,"see in the world two heterogeneous and incompatible worlds, though",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing sensible experience seems able to suggest the idea of so radical,Elementary Forms
41360,a duality to them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, this definition is not yet complete, for it is equally",Elementary Forms
41360,"applicable to two sorts of facts which, while being related to each",Elementary Forms
41360,"other, must be distinguished nevertheless: these are magic and religion.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Magic, too, is made up of beliefs and rites. Like religion, it has its",Elementary Forms
41360,"myths and its dogmas; only they are more elementary, undoubtedly",Elementary Forms
41360,"because, seeking technical and utilitarian ends, it does not waste its",Elementary Forms
41360,"time in pure speculation. It has its ceremonies, sacrifices,",Elementary Forms
41360,"lustrations, prayers, chants and dances as well. The beings which the",Elementary Forms
41360,magician invokes and the forces which he throws in play are not merely,Elementary Forms
41360,of the same nature as the forces and beings to which religion addresses,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself; very frequently, they are identically the same. Thus, even with",Elementary Forms
41360,"the most inferior societies, the souls of the dead are essentially",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred things, and the object of religious rites. But at the same time,",Elementary Forms
41360,they play a considerable role in magic. In Australia[74] as well as in,Elementary Forms
41360,"Melanesia,[75] in Greece as well as among the Christian peoples,[76] the",Elementary Forms
41360,"souls of the dead, their bones and their hair, are among the",Elementary Forms
41360,intermediaries used the most frequently by the magician. Demons are also,Elementary Forms
41360,a common instrument for magic action. Now these demons are also beings,Elementary Forms
41360,surrounded with interdictions; they too are separated and live in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"world apart, so that it is frequently difficult to distinguish them",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the gods properly so-called.[77] Moreover, in Christianity itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not the devil a fallen god, or even leaving aside all question of his",Elementary Forms
41360,"origin, does he not have a religious character from the mere fact that",Elementary Forms
41360,the hell of which he has charge is something indispensable to the,Elementary Forms
41360,Christian religion? There are even some regular and official deities who,Elementary Forms
41360,are invoked by the magician. Sometimes these are the gods of a foreign,Elementary Forms
41360,"people; for example, Greek magicians called upon Egyptian, Assyrian or",Elementary Forms
41360,"Jewish gods. Sometimes, they are even national gods: Hecate and Diana",Elementary Forms
41360,"were the object of a magic cult; the Virgin, Christ and the saints have",Elementary Forms
41360,been utilized in the same way by Christian magicians.[78],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Then will it be necessary to say that magic is hardly distinguishable,Elementary Forms
41360,from religion; that magic is full of religion just as religion is full,Elementary Forms
41360,"of magic, and consequently that it is impossible to separate them and to",Elementary Forms
41360,define the one without the other? It is difficult to sustain this,Elementary Forms
41360,"thesis, because of the marked repugnance of religion for magic, and in",Elementary Forms
41360,"return, the hostility of the second towards the first. Magic takes a",Elementary Forms
41360,sort of professional pleasure in profaning holy things;[79] in its,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, it performs the contrary of the religious ceremony.[80] On its",Elementary Forms
41360,"side, religion, when it has not condemned and prohibited magic rites,",Elementary Forms
41360,has always looked upon them with disfavour. As Hubert and Mauss have,Elementary Forms
41360,"remarked, there is something thoroughly anti-religious in the doings of",Elementary Forms
41360,the magician.[81] Whatever relations there may be between these two,Elementary Forms
41360,"sorts of institutions, it is difficult to imagine their not being",Elementary Forms
41360,opposed somewhere; and it is still more necessary for us to find where,Elementary Forms
41360,"they are differentiated, as we plan to limit our researches to religion,",Elementary Forms
41360,and to stop at the point where magic commences.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Here is how a line of demarcation can be traced between these two,Elementary Forms
41360,domains.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The really religious beliefs are always common to a determined group,",Elementary Forms
41360,which makes profession of adhering to them and of practising the rites,Elementary Forms
41360,connected with them. They are not merely received individually by all,Elementary Forms
41360,"the members of this group; they are something belonging to the group,",Elementary Forms
41360,and they make its unity. The individuals which compose it feel,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves united to each other by the simple fact that they have a,Elementary Forms
41360,common faith. A society whose members are united by the fact that they,Elementary Forms
41360,think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations,Elementary Forms
41360,"with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history,",Elementary Forms
41360,we do not find a single religion without a Church. Sometimes the Church,Elementary Forms
41360,"is strictly national, sometimes it passes the frontiers; sometimes it",Elementary Forms
41360,"embraces an entire people (Rome, Athens, the Hebrews), sometimes it",Elementary Forms
41360,embraces only a part of them (the Christian societies since the advent,Elementary Forms
41360,"of Protestantism); sometimes it is directed by a corps of priests,",Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes it is almost completely devoid of any official directing,Elementary Forms
41360,"body.[82] But wherever we observe the religious life, we find that it",Elementary Forms
41360,has a definite group as its foundation. Even the so-called private,Elementary Forms
41360,"cults, such as the domestic cult or the cult of a corporation, satisfy",Elementary Forms
41360,"this condition; for they are always celebrated by a group, the family or",Elementary Forms
41360,"the corporation. Moreover, even these particular religions are",Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily only special forms of a more general religion which embraces,Elementary Forms
41360,all;[83] these restricted Churches are in reality only chapels of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"vaster Church which, by reason of this very extent, merits this name",Elementary Forms
41360,still more.[84],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is quite another matter with magic. To be sure, the belief in magic",Elementary Forms
41360,is always more or less general; it is very frequently diffused in large,Elementary Forms
41360,"masses of the population, and there are even peoples where it has as",Elementary Forms
41360,many adherents as the real religion. But it does not result in binding,Elementary Forms
41360,"together those who adhere to it, nor in uniting them into a group",Elementary Forms
41360,leading a common life. _There is no Church of magic._ Between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"magician and the individuals who consult him, as between these",Elementary Forms
41360,"individuals themselves, there are no lasting bonds which make them",Elementary Forms
41360,"members of the same moral community, comparable to that formed by the",Elementary Forms
41360,believers in the same god or the observers of the same cult. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"magician has a clientele and not a Church, and it is very possible that",Elementary Forms
41360,"his clients have no other relations between each other, or even do not",Elementary Forms
41360,know each other; even the relations which they have with him are,Elementary Forms
41360,generally accidental and transient; they are just like those of a sick,Elementary Forms
41360,man with his physician. The official and public character with which he,Elementary Forms
41360,is sometimes invested changes nothing in this situation; the fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,he works openly does not unite him more regularly or more durably to,Elementary Forms
41360,those who have recourse to his services.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is true that in certain cases, magicians form societies among",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves: it happens that they assemble more or less periodically to,Elementary Forms
41360,celebrate certain rites in common; it is well known what a place these,Elementary Forms
41360,assemblies of witches hold in European folk-lore. But it is to be,Elementary Forms
41360,remarked that these associations are in no way indispensable to the,Elementary Forms
41360,working of the magic; they are even rare and rather exceptional. The,Elementary Forms
41360,magician has no need of uniting himself to his fellows to practise his,Elementary Forms
41360,"art. More frequently, he is a recluse; in general, far from seeking",Elementary Forms
41360,"society, he flees it. ""Even in regard to his colleagues, he always keeps",Elementary Forms
41360,"his personal independence.""[85] Religion, on the other hand, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"inseparable from the idea of a Church. From this point of view, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,an essential difference between magic and religion. But what is,Elementary Forms
41360,"especially important is that when these societies of magic are formed,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they do not include all the adherents to magic, but only the magicians;",Elementary Forms
41360,"the laymen, if they may be so called, that is to say, those for whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"profit the rites are celebrated, in fine, those who represent the",Elementary Forms
41360,"worshippers in the regular cults, are excluded. Now the magician is for",Elementary Forms
41360,"magic what the priest is for religion, but a college of priests is not a",Elementary Forms
41360,"Church, any more than a religious congregation which should devote",Elementary Forms
41360,"itself to some particular saint in the shadow of a cloister, would be a",Elementary Forms
41360,particular cult. A Church is not a fraternity of priests; it is a moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"community formed by all the believers in a single faith, laymen as well",Elementary Forms
41360,as priests. But magic lacks any such community.[86],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if the idea of a Church is made to enter into the definition of,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, does that not exclude the private religions which the",Elementary Forms
41360,individual establishes for himself and celebrates by himself? There is,Elementary Forms
41360,"scarcely a society where these are not found. Every Ojibway, as we shall",Elementary Forms
41360,"see below, has his own personal _manitou_, which he chooses himself and",Elementary Forms
41360,to which he renders special religious services; the Melanesian of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Banks Islands has his _tamaniu_;[87] the Roman, his _genius_;[88] the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Christian, his patron saint and guardian angel, etc. By definition all",Elementary Forms
41360,these cults seem to be independent of all idea of the group. Not only,Elementary Forms
41360,"are these individual religions very frequent in history, but nowadays",Elementary Forms
41360,many are asking if they are not destined to be the pre-eminent form of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the religious life, and if the day will not come when there will be no",Elementary Forms
41360,other cult than that which each man will freely perform within,Elementary Forms
41360,himself.[89],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if we leave these speculations in regard to the future aside for the,Elementary Forms
41360,"moment, and confine ourselves to religions such as they are at present",Elementary Forms
41360,"or have been in the past, it becomes clearly evident that these",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual cults are not distinct and autonomous religious systems, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"merely aspects of the common religion of the whole Church, of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,individuals are members. The patron saint of the Christian is chosen,Elementary Forms
41360,from the official list of saints recognized by the Catholic Church;,Elementary Forms
41360,there are even canonical rules prescribing how each Catholic should,Elementary Forms
41360,"perform this private cult. In the same way, the idea that each man",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessarily has a protecting genius is found, under different forms, at",Elementary Forms
41360,"the basis of a great number of American religions, as well as of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Roman religion (to cite only these two examples); for, as will be seen",Elementary Forms
41360,"later, it is very closely connected with the idea of the soul, and this",Elementary Forms
41360,idea of the soul is not one of those which can be left entirely to,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual choice. In a word, it is the Church of which he is a member",Elementary Forms
41360,"which teaches the individual what these personal gods are, what their",Elementary Forms
41360,"function is, how he should enter into relations with them and how he",Elementary Forms
41360,should honour them. When a methodical analysis is made of the doctrines,Elementary Forms
41360,"of any Church whatsoever, sooner or later we come upon those concerning",Elementary Forms
41360,"private cults. So these are not two religions of different types, and",Elementary Forms
41360,turned in opposite directions; both are made up of the same ideas and,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same principles, here applied to circumstances which are of interest",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the group as a whole, there to the life of the individual. This",Elementary Forms
41360,"solidarity is even so close that among certain peoples,[90] the",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies by which the faithful first enter into communication with,Elementary Forms
41360,their protecting geniuses are mixed with rites whose public character is,Elementary Forms
41360,"incontestable, namely the rites of initiation.[91]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There still remain those contemporary aspirations towards a religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"which would consist entirely in internal and subjective states, and",Elementary Forms
41360,which would be constructed freely by each of us. But howsoever real,Elementary Forms
41360,"these aspirations may be, they cannot affect our definition, for this is",Elementary Forms
41360,"to be applied only to facts already realized, and not to uncertain",Elementary Forms
41360,"possibilities. One can define religions such as they are, or such as",Elementary Forms
41360,"they have been, but not such as they more or less vaguely tend to",Elementary Forms
41360,become. It is possible that this religious individualism is destined to,Elementary Forms
41360,be realized in facts; but before we can say just how far this may be the,Elementary Forms
41360,"case, we must first know what religion is, of what elements it is made",Elementary Forms
41360,"up, from what causes it results, and what function it fulfils--all",Elementary Forms
41360,questions whose solution cannot be foreseen before the threshold of our,Elementary Forms
41360,study has been passed. It is only at the close of this study that we can,Elementary Forms
41360,attempt to anticipate the future.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus we arrive at the following definition: _A religion is a unified,Elementary Forms
41360,"system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, things set apart and forbidden--beliefs and practices which unite",Elementary Forms
41360,"into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to",Elementary Forms
41360,them._ The second element which thus finds a place in our definition is,Elementary Forms
41360,no less essential than the first; for by showing that the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is inseparable from that of the Church, it makes it clear that",Elementary Forms
41360,religion should be an eminently collective thing.[92],Elementary Forms

41360,I.--_Animism_,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Armed with this definition, we are now able to set out in search of this",Elementary Forms
41360,elementary religion which we propose to study.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Even the crudest religions with which history and ethnology make us,Elementary Forms
41360,acquainted are already of a complexity which corresponds badly with the,Elementary Forms
41360,idea sometimes held of primitive mentality. One finds there not only a,Elementary Forms
41360,"confused system of beliefs and rites, but also such a plurality of",Elementary Forms
41360,"different principles, and such a richness of essential notions, that it",Elementary Forms
41360,seems impossible to see in them anything but the late product of a,Elementary Forms
41360,rather long evolution. Hence it has been concluded that to discover the,Elementary Forms
41360,"truly original form of the religious life, it is necessary to descend by",Elementary Forms
41360,"analysis beyond these observable religions, to resolve them into their",Elementary Forms
41360,"common and fundamental elements, and then to seek among these latter",Elementary Forms
41360,some one from which the others were derived.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"To the problem thus stated, two contrary solutions have been given.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"There is no religious system, ancient or recent, where one does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"meet, under different forms, two religions, as it were, side by side,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which, though being united closely and mutually penetrating each other,",Elementary Forms
41360,"do not cease, nevertheless, to be distinct. The one addresses itself to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the phenomena of nature, either the great cosmic forces, such as winds,",Elementary Forms
41360,"rivers, stars or the sky, etc., or else the objects of various sorts",Elementary Forms
41360,"which cover the surface of the earth, such as plants, animals, rocks,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.; for this reason it has been given the name of _naturism_. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"other has spiritual beings as its object, spirits, souls, geniuses,",Elementary Forms
41360,"demons, divinities properly so-called, animated and conscious agents",Elementary Forms
41360,"like man, but distinguished from him, nevertheless, by the nature of",Elementary Forms
41360,their powers and especially by the peculiar characteristic that they do,Elementary Forms
41360,not affect the senses in the same way: ordinarily they are not visible,Elementary Forms
41360,"to human eyes. This religion of spirits is called _animism_. Now, to",Elementary Forms
41360,"explain the universal co-existence of these two sorts of cults, two",Elementary Forms
41360,"contradictory theories have been proposed. For some, animism is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive religion, of which naturism is only a secondary and derived",Elementary Forms
41360,"form. For the others, on the contrary, it is the nature cult which was",Elementary Forms
41360,the point of departure for religious evolution; the cult of spirits is,Elementary Forms
41360,only a peculiar case of that.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"These two theories are, up to the present, the only ones by which the",Elementary Forms
41360,attempt has been made to explain rationally[93] the origins of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,thought. Thus the capital problem raised by the history of religions is,Elementary Forms
41360,generally reduced to asking which of these two solutions should be,Elementary Forms
41360,"chosen, or whether it is not better to combine them, and in that case,",Elementary Forms
41360,what place must be given to each of the two elements.[94] Even those,Elementary Forms
41360,scholars who do not admit either of these hypotheses in their systematic,Elementary Forms
41360,"form, do not refuse to retain certain propositions upon which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"rest.[95] Thus we have a certain number of theories already made, which",Elementary Forms
41360,must be submitted to criticism before we take up the study of the facts,Elementary Forms
41360,for ourselves. It will be better understood how indispensable it is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"attempt a new one, when we have seen the insufficiency of these",Elementary Forms
41360,traditional conceptions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,It is Tylor who formed the animist theory in its essential outlines.[96],Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer, who took it up after him, did not reproduce it without",Elementary Forms
41360,introducing certain modifications.[97] But in general the questions are,Elementary Forms
41360,"posed by each in the same terms, and the solutions accepted are, with a",Elementary Forms
41360,"single exception, identically the same. Therefore we can unite these two",Elementary Forms
41360,"doctrines in the exposition which follows, if we mark, at the proper",Elementary Forms
41360,"moment, the place where the two diverge from one another.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In order to find the elementary form of the religious life in these,Elementary Forms
41360,"animistic beliefs and practices, three _desiderata_ must be satisfied:",Elementary Forms
41360,"first, since according to this hypothesis, the idea of the soul is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"cardinal idea of religion, it must be shown how this is formed without",Elementary Forms
41360,"taking any of its elements from an anterior religion; secondly, it must",Elementary Forms
41360,be made clear how souls become the object of a cult and are transformed,Elementary Forms
41360,"into spirits; and thirdly and finally, since the cult of these spirits",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not all of any religion, it remains to be explained how the cult of",Elementary Forms
41360,nature is derived from it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to this theory, the idea of the soul was first suggested to",Elementary Forms
41360,men by the badly understood spectacle of the double life they ordinarily,Elementary Forms
41360,"lead, on the one hand, when awake, on the other, when asleep. In fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the savage,[98] the mental representations which he has while awake",Elementary Forms
41360,and those of his dreams are said to be of the same value: he objectifies,Elementary Forms
41360,"the second like the first, that is to say, that he sees in them the",Elementary Forms
41360,images of external objects whose appearance they more or less accurately,Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduce. So when he dreams that he has visited a distant country, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"believes that he really was there. But he could not have gone there,",Elementary Forms
41360,"unless two beings exist within him: the one, his body, which has",Elementary Forms
41360,remained lying on the ground and which he finds in the same position on,Elementary Forms
41360,"awakening; the other, during this time, has travelled through space.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Similarly, if he seems to talk with one of his companions who he knows",Elementary Forms
41360,"was really at a distance, he concludes that the other also is composed",Elementary Forms
41360,"of two beings: one which sleeps at a distance, and another which has",Elementary Forms
41360,come to manifest himself by means of the dream. From these repeated,Elementary Forms
41360,"experiences, he little by little arrives at the idea that each of us has",Elementary Forms
41360,"a double, another self, which in determined conditions has the power of",Elementary Forms
41360,leaving the organism where it resides and of going roaming at a,Elementary Forms
41360,distance.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Of course, this double reproduces all the essential traits of the",Elementary Forms
41360,perceptible being which serves it as external covering; but at the same,Elementary Forms
41360,time it is distinguished from this by many characteristics. It is more,Elementary Forms
41360,"active, since it can cover vast distances in an instant. It is more",Elementary Forms
41360,"malleable and plastic; for, to leave the body, it must pass out by its",Elementary Forms
41360,"apertures, especially the mouth and nose. It is represented as made of",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter, undoubtedly, but of a matter much more subtile and etherial than",Elementary Forms
41360,"any which we know empirically. This double is the soul. In fact, it",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot be doubted that in numerous societies the soul has been conceived,Elementary Forms
41360,in the image of the body; it is believed that it reproduces even the,Elementary Forms
41360,accidental deformities such as those resulting from wounds or,Elementary Forms
41360,"mutilations. Certain Australians, after having killed their enemy, cut",Elementary Forms
41360,"off his right thumb, so that his soul, deprived of its thumb also,",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot throw a javelin and revenge itself. But while it resembles the,Elementary Forms
41360,"body, it has, at the same time, something half spiritual about it. They",Elementary Forms
41360,"say that ""it is the finer or more aeriform part of the body,"" that ""it",Elementary Forms
41360,"has no flesh nor bone nor sinew""; that when one wishes to take hold of",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, he feels nothing; that it is ""like a purified body.""[99]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, other facts of experience which affect the mind in the same way",Elementary Forms
41360,naturally group themselves around this fundamental fact taught by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"dream: fainting, apoplexy, catalepsy, ecstasy, in a word, all cases of",Elementary Forms
41360,"temporary insensibility. In fact, they all are explained very well by",Elementary Forms
41360,the hypothesis that the principle of life and feeling is able to leave,Elementary Forms
41360,"the body momentarily. Also, it is natural that this principle should be",Elementary Forms
41360,"confounded with the double, since the absence of the double during sleep",Elementary Forms
41360,daily has the effect of suspending thought and life. Thus diverse,Elementary Forms
41360,observations seem to agree mutually and to confirm the idea of the,Elementary Forms
41360,constitutional duality of man.[100],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the soul is not a spirit. It is attached to a body which it can,Elementary Forms
41360,"leave only by exception; in so far as it is nothing more than that, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not the object of any cult. The spirit, on the other hand, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"generally having some special thing as its residence, can go away at",Elementary Forms
41360,"will, and a man can enter into relations with it only by observing",Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual precautions. The soul can become a spirit, then, only by",Elementary Forms
41360,transforming itself: the simple application of these preceding ideas to,Elementary Forms
41360,the fact of death produced this metamorphosis quite naturally. For a,Elementary Forms
41360,"rudimentary intelligence, in fact, death is not distinguished from a",Elementary Forms
41360,long fainting swoon or a prolonged sleep; it has all their aspects. Thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"it seems that it too consists in a separation of the soul and the body,",Elementary Forms
41360,"analogous to that produced every night; but as in such cases, the body",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not reanimated, the idea is formed of a separation without an",Elementary Forms
41360,assignable limit of time. When the body is once destroyed--and funeral,Elementary Forms
41360,rites have the object of hastening this destruction--the separation is,Elementary Forms
41360,taken as final. Hence come spirits detached from any organism and left,Elementary Forms
41360,"free in space. As their number augments with time, a population of",Elementary Forms
41360,souls forms around the living population. These souls of men have the,Elementary Forms
41360,needs and passions of men; they seek to concern themselves with the life,Elementary Forms
41360,"of their companions of yesterday, either to aid them or to injure them,",Elementary Forms
41360,according to the sentiments which they have kept towards them. According,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the circumstances, their nature makes them either very precious",Elementary Forms
41360,auxiliaries or very redoubtable adversaries. Owing to their extreme,Elementary Forms
41360,"fluidity, they can even enter into the body, and cause all sorts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"disorders there, or else increase its vitality. Thus comes the habit of",Elementary Forms
41360,attributing to them all those events of life which vary slightly from,Elementary Forms
41360,the ordinary: there are very few of these for which they cannot account.,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus they constitute a sort of ever-ready supply of causes which never,Elementary Forms
41360,leaves one at a loss when in search of explanations. Does a man appear,Elementary Forms
41360,"inspired, does he speak with energy, is it as though he were lifted",Elementary Forms
41360,outside himself and above the ordinary level of men? It is because a,Elementary Forms
41360,good spirit is in him and animates him. Is he overtaken by an attack or,Elementary Forms
41360,seized by madness? It is because an evil spirit has entered into him and,Elementary Forms
41360,brought him all this trouble. There are no maladies which cannot be,Elementary Forms
41360,assigned to some influence of this sort. Thus the power of souls is,Elementary Forms
41360,"increased by all that men attribute to them, and in the end men find",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves the prisoners of this imaginary world of which they are,",Elementary Forms
41360,"however, the authors and the models. They fall into dependence upon",Elementary Forms
41360,these spiritual forces which they have created with their own hands and,Elementary Forms
41360,"in their own image. For if souls are the givers of health and sickness,",Elementary Forms
41360,"of goods and evils to this extent, it is wise to conciliate their favour",Elementary Forms
41360,"or appease them when they are irritated; hence come the offerings,",Elementary Forms
41360,"prayers, sacrifices, in a word, all the apparatus of religious",Elementary Forms
41360,observances.[101],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Here is the soul transformed. From a simple vital principle animating,Elementary Forms
41360,"the body of a man, it has become a spirit, a good or evil genius, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"even a deity, according to the importance of the effects with which it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is charged. But since it is death which brought about this apotheosis,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is to the dead, to the souls of ancestors, that the first cult known",Elementary Forms
41360,to humanity was addressed. Thus the first rites were funeral rites; the,Elementary Forms
41360,first sacrifices were food offerings destined to satisfy the needs of,Elementary Forms
41360,the departed; the first altars were tombs.[102],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But since these spirits were of human origin, they interested themselves",Elementary Forms
41360,only in the life of men and were thought to act only upon human events.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is still to be explained how other spirits were imagined to account,Elementary Forms
41360,for the other phenomena of the universe and how the cult of nature was,Elementary Forms
41360,subsequently formed beside that of the ancestors.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"For Tylor, this extension of animism was due to the particular mentality",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the primitive who, like an infant, cannot distinguish the animate and",Elementary Forms
41360,the inanimate. Since the first beings of which the child commences to,Elementary Forms
41360,"have an idea are men, that is, himself and those around him, it is upon",Elementary Forms
41360,this model of human nature that he tends to think of everything. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"toys with which he plays, or the objects of every sort which affect his",Elementary Forms
41360,"senses, he regards as living beings like himself. Now the primitive",Elementary Forms
41360,"thinks like a child. Consequently, he also is inclined to endow all",Elementary Forms
41360,"things, even inanimate ones, with a nature analogous to his own. Then",Elementary Forms
41360,"if, for the reasons exposed above, he once arrives at the idea that man",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a body animated by a spirit, he must necessarily attribute a duality",Elementary Forms
41360,of this sort and souls like his own even to inert bodies themselves. Yet,Elementary Forms
41360,the sphere of action of the two could not be the same. The souls of men,Elementary Forms
41360,have a direct influence only upon the world of men: they have a marked,Elementary Forms
41360,"preference for the human organism, even when death has given them their",Elementary Forms
41360,"liberty. On the other hand, the souls of things reside especially in",Elementary Forms
41360,"these things, and are regarded as the productive causes of all that",Elementary Forms
41360,"passes there. The first account for health and sickness, skilfulness or",Elementary Forms
41360,"unskilfulness, etc.; by the second are explained especially the",Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena of the physical world, the movement of water-courses or the",Elementary Forms
41360,"stars, the germination of plants, the reproduction of animals, etc. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"the first philosophy of man, which is at the basis of the ancestor-cult,",Elementary Forms
41360,is completed by a philosophy of the world.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In regard to these cosmic spirits, man finds himself in a state of",Elementary Forms
41360,dependence still more evident than that in regard to the wandering,Elementary Forms
41360,doubles of his ancestors. For he could have only ideal and imaginary,Elementary Forms
41360,"relations with the latter, but he depends upon things in reality; to",Elementary Forms
41360,"live, he has need of their concurrence; he then believes that he has an",Elementary Forms
41360,equal need of the spirits which appear to animate these things and to,Elementary Forms
41360,"determine their diverse manifestations. He implores their assistance, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"solicits them with offerings and prayers, and the religion of man is",Elementary Forms
41360,thus completed in a religion of nature.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Herbert Spencer objects against this explanation that the hypothesis,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which it rests is contradicted by the facts. It is held, he says,",Elementary Forms
41360,that there is a time when men do not realize the differences which,Elementary Forms
41360,"separate the animate from the inanimate. Now, as one advances in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal scale, he sees the ability to make this distinction develop. The",Elementary Forms
41360,superior animals do not confound an object which moves of itself and,Elementary Forms
41360,"whose movements are adapted to certain ends, with those which are",Elementary Forms
41360,"mechanically moved from without. ""Amusing herself with a mouse she has",Elementary Forms
41360,"caught, the cat, if it remains long stationary, touches it with her paw",Elementary Forms
41360,to make it run. Obviously the thought is that a living thing disturbed,Elementary Forms
41360,"will try to escape.""[103] Even the primitive men could not have an",Elementary Forms
41360,intelligence inferior to that of the animals which preceded them in,Elementary Forms
41360,evolution; then it cannot be for lack of discernment that they passed,Elementary Forms
41360,from the cult of ancestors to the cult of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to Spencer, who upon this point, but upon this point only,",Elementary Forms
41360,"differs from Tylor, this passage was certainly due to a confusion, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"to one of a different sort. It was, in a large part at least, the result",Elementary Forms
41360,of numerous errors due to language. In many inferior societies it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"very common custom to give to each individual, either at his birth or",Elementary Forms
41360,"later, the name of some animal, plant, star or natural object. But as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequence of the extreme imprecision of his language, it is very",Elementary Forms
41360,difficult for a primitive to distinguish a metaphor from the reality. He,Elementary Forms
41360,"soon lost sight of the fact that these names were only figures, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"taking them literally, he ended by believing that an ancestor named",Elementary Forms
41360,"""Tiger"" or ""Lion"" was really a tiger or a lion. Then the cult of which",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ancestor was the object up to that time, was changed over to the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal with which he was thereafter confounded; and as the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"substitution went on for the plants, the stars and all the natural",Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena, the religion of nature took the place of the old religion of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the dead. Besides this fundamental confusion, Spencer signalizes others",Elementary Forms
41360,"which aided the action of the first from time to time. For example, the",Elementary Forms
41360,animals which frequent the surroundings of the tombs or houses of men,Elementary Forms
41360,"have been taken for their reincarnated souls, and adored under this",Elementary Forms
41360,"title;[104] or again, the mountain which tradition made the cradle of",Elementary Forms
41360,the race was finally taken for the ancestor of the race; it was thought,Elementary Forms
41360,that men were descended from it because their ancestors appeared coming,Elementary Forms
41360,"from it, and it was consequently treated as an ancestor itself.[105] But",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to the statement of Spencer, these accessory causes had only a",Elementary Forms
41360,secondary influence; that which principally determined the institution,Elementary Forms
41360,"of naturism was ""the literal interpretation of metaphorical names.""[106]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We had to mention this theory to have our exposition of animism,Elementary Forms
41360,"complete; but it is too inadequate for the facts, and too universally",Elementary Forms
41360,abandoned to-day to demand that we stop any longer for it. In order to,Elementary Forms
41360,"explain a fact as general as the religion of nature by an illusion, it",Elementary Forms
41360,would be necessary that the illusion invoked should have causes of an,Elementary Forms
41360,"equal generality. Now even if misunderstandings, such as those of which",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer gives some rare illustrations, could explain the transformation",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the cult of ancestors into that of nature, it is not clear why this",Elementary Forms
41360,should be produced with a sort of universality. No psychical mechanism,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessitated it. It is true that because of its ambiguity, the word",Elementary Forms
41360,"might lead to an equivocation; but on the other hand, all the personal",Elementary Forms
41360,souvenirs left by the ancestor in the memories of men should oppose this,Elementary Forms
41360,confusion. Why should the tradition which represented the ancestor such,Elementary Forms
41360,"as he really was, that is to say, as a man who led the life of a man,",Elementary Forms
41360,"everywhere give way before the prestige of a word? Likewise, one should",Elementary Forms
41360,have a little difficulty in admitting that men were born of a mountain,Elementary Forms
41360,"or a star, of an animal or a plant; the idea of a similar exception to",Elementary Forms
41360,the ordinary conceptions of generation could not fail to raise active,Elementary Forms
41360,"resistance. Thus, it is far from true that the error found a road all",Elementary Forms
41360,"prepared before it, but rather, all sorts of reasons should have kept it",Elementary Forms
41360,"from being accepted. It is difficult to understand how, in spite of all",Elementary Forms
41360,"these obstacles, it could have triumphed so generally.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The theory of Tylor, whose authority is always great, still remains. His",Elementary Forms
41360,hypotheses on the dream and the origin of the ideas of the soul and of,Elementary Forms
41360,"spirits are still classic; it is necessary, therefore, to test their",Elementary Forms
41360,value.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"First of all, it should be recognized that the theorists of animism have",Elementary Forms
41360,"rendered an important service to the science of religions, and even to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the general history of ideas, by submitting the idea of the soul to",Elementary Forms
41360,historical analysis. Instead of following so many philosophers and,Elementary Forms
41360,"making it a simple and immediate object of consciousness, they have much",Elementary Forms
41360,"more correctly viewed it as a complex whole, a product of history and",Elementary Forms
41360,mythology. It cannot be doubted that it is something essentially,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious in its nature, origin and functions. It is from religion that",Elementary Forms
41360,the philosophers received it; it is impossible to understand the form in,Elementary Forms
41360,"which it is represented by the thinkers of antiquity, if one does not",Elementary Forms
41360,take into account the mythical elements which served in its formation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if Tylor has had the merit of raising this problem, the solution he",Elementary Forms
41360,gives raises grave difficulties.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"First of all, there are reservations to be made in regard to the very",Elementary Forms
41360,principle which is at the basis of this theory. It is taken for granted,Elementary Forms
41360,"that the soul is entirely distinct from the body, that it is its double,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and that within it or outside of it, it normally lives its own",Elementary Forms
41360,autonomous life. Now we shall see[107] that this conception is not that,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the primitive, or at least, that it only expresses one aspect of his",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of the soul. For him, the soul, though being under certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"conditions independent of the organism which it animates, confounds",Elementary Forms
41360,itself with this latter to such an extent that it cannot be radically,Elementary Forms
41360,separated from it: there are organs which are not only its appointed,Elementary Forms
41360,"seat, but also its outward form and material manifestation. The notion",Elementary Forms
41360,"is therefore more complex than the doctrine supposes, and it is doubtful",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently whether the experiences mentioned are sufficient to account,Elementary Forms
41360,for it; for even if they did enable us to understand how men have come,Elementary Forms
41360,"to believe themselves double, they cannot explain how this duality does",Elementary Forms
41360,"not exclude, but rather, implies a deeper unity and an intimate",Elementary Forms
41360,interpenetration of the two beings thus differentiated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But let us admit that the idea of the soul can be reduced to the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,"a double, and then see how this latter came to be formed. It could not",Elementary Forms
41360,have been suggested to men except by the experience of dreams. That they,Elementary Forms
41360,might understand how they could see places more or less distant during,Elementary Forms
41360,"sleep, while their bodies remained lying on the ground, it would seem",Elementary Forms
41360,that they were led to conceive of themselves as two beings: on the one,Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, the body, and on the other, a second self, able to leave the",Elementary Forms
41360,organism in which it lives and to roam about in space. But if this,Elementary Forms
41360,hypothesis of a double is to be able to impose itself upon men with a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of necessity, it should be the only one possible, or at least, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"most economical one. Now as a matter of fact, there are more simple ones",Elementary Forms
41360,"which, it would seem, might have occurred to the mind just as naturally.",Elementary Forms
41360,"For example, why should the sleeper not imagine that while asleep he is",Elementary Forms
41360,able to see things at a distance? To imagine such a power would demand,Elementary Forms
41360,less expense to the imagination than the construction of this complex,Elementary Forms
41360,"notion of a double, made of some etherial, semi-invisible substance, and",Elementary Forms
41360,of which direct experience offers no example. But even supposing that,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain dreams rather naturally suggest the animistic explanation, there",Elementary Forms
41360,are certainly many others which are absolutely incompatible with it.,Elementary Forms
41360,Often our dreams are concerned with passed events; we see again the,Elementary Forms
41360,things which we saw or did yesterday or the day before or even during,Elementary Forms
41360,"our youth, etc.; dreams of this sort are frequent and hold a rather",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable place in our nocturnal life. But the idea of a double,Elementary Forms
41360,cannot account for them. Even if the double can go from one point to,Elementary Forms
41360,"another in space, it is not clear how it could possibly go back and",Elementary Forms
41360,"forth in time. Howsoever rudimentary his intelligence may be, how could",Elementary Forms
41360,a man on awakening believe that he had really been assisting at or,Elementary Forms
41360,taking part in events which he knows passed long before? How could he,Elementary Forms
41360,imagine that during his sleep he lived a life which he knows has long,Elementary Forms
41360,since gone by? It would be much more natural that he should regard these,Elementary Forms
41360,"renewed images as merely what they really are, that is, as souvenirs",Elementary Forms
41360,"like those which he has during the day, but ones of a special intensity.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, in the scenes of which we are the actors and witnesses while",Elementary Forms
41360,"we sleep, it constantly happens that one of our contemporaries has a",Elementary Forms
41360,role as well as ourselves: we think we see and hear him in the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"place where we see ourselves. According to the animists, the primitive",Elementary Forms
41360,would explain this by imagining that his double was visited by or met,Elementary Forms
41360,with those of certain of his companions. But it would be enough that on,Elementary Forms
41360,"awakening he question them, to find that their experiences do not",Elementary Forms
41360,"coincide with his. During this same time, they too have had dreams, but",Elementary Forms
41360,wholly different ones. They have not seen themselves participating in,Elementary Forms
41360,the same scene; they believe that they have visited wholly different,Elementary Forms
41360,"places. Since such contradictions should be the rule in these cases, why",Elementary Forms
41360,should they not lead men to believe that there had probably been an,Elementary Forms
41360,"error, that they had merely imagined it, that they had been duped by",Elementary Forms
41360,illusions? This blind credulity which is attributed to the primitive is,Elementary Forms
41360,really too simple. It is not true that he must objectify all his,Elementary Forms
41360,sensations. He cannot live long without perceiving that even when awake,Elementary Forms
41360,his senses sometimes deceive him. Then why should he believe them more,Elementary Forms
41360,infallible at night than during the day? Thus we find that there are,Elementary Forms
41360,many reasons opposing the theory that he takes his dreams for the,Elementary Forms
41360,reality and interprets them by means of a double of himself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But more than that, even if every dream were well explained by the",Elementary Forms
41360,"hypothesis of a double, and could not be explained otherwise, it would",Elementary Forms
41360,remain a question why men have attempted to explain them. Dreams,Elementary Forms
41360,undoubtedly constitute the matter of a possible problem. But we pass by,Elementary Forms
41360,"problems every day which we do not raise, and of which we have no",Elementary Forms
41360,suspicion until some circumstance makes us feel the necessity of raising,Elementary Forms
41360,"them. Even when the taste for pure speculation is aroused, reflection is",Elementary Forms
41360,far from raising all the problems to which it could eventually apply,Elementary Forms
41360,itself; only those attract it which present a particular interest.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Especially, when it is a question of facts which always take place in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same manner, habit easily numbs curiosity, and we do not even dream",Elementary Forms
41360,"of questioning them. To shake off this torpor, it is necessary that",Elementary Forms
41360,"practical exigencies, or at least a very pressing theoretical interest,",Elementary Forms
41360,"stimulate our attention and turn it in this direction. That is why, at",Elementary Forms
41360,"every moment of history, there have been so many things that we have not",Elementary Forms
41360,"tried to understand, without even being conscious of our renunciation.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Up until very recent times, it was believed that the sun was only a few",Elementary Forms
41360,feet in diameter. There is something incomprehensible in the statement,Elementary Forms
41360,that a luminous disc of such slight dimensions could illuminate the,Elementary Forms
41360,world: yet for centuries men never thought of resolving this,Elementary Forms
41360,"contradiction. The fact of heredity has been known for a long time, but",Elementary Forms
41360,it is very recently that the attempt has been made to formulate its,Elementary Forms
41360,theory. Certain beliefs were even admitted which rendered it wholly,Elementary Forms
41360,unintelligible: thus in many Australian societies of which we shall have,Elementary Forms
41360,"occasion to speak, the child is not physiologically the offspring of its",Elementary Forms
41360,parents.[108] This intellectual laziness is necessarily at its maximum,Elementary Forms
41360,"among the primitive peoples. These weak beings, who have so much trouble",Elementary Forms
41360,"in maintaining life against all the forces which assail it, have no",Elementary Forms
41360,means for supporting any luxury in the way of speculation. They do not,Elementary Forms
41360,reflect except when they are driven to it. Now it is difficult to see,Elementary Forms
41360,what could have led them to make dreams the theme of their meditations.,Elementary Forms
41360,What does the dream amount to in our lives? How little is the place it,Elementary Forms
41360,"holds, especially because of the very vague impressions it leaves in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"memory, and of the rapidity with which it is effaced from remembrance,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and consequently, how surprising it is that a man of so rudimentary an",Elementary Forms
41360,intelligence should have expended such efforts to find its explanation!,Elementary Forms
41360,"Of the two existences which he successively leads, that of the day and",Elementary Forms
41360,"that of the night, it is the first which should interest him the most.",Elementary Forms
41360,Is it not strange that the second should have so captivated his,Elementary Forms
41360,attention that he made it the basis of a whole system of complicated,Elementary Forms
41360,ideas destined to have so profound an influence upon his thought and,Elementary Forms
41360,conduct?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus all tends to show that, in spite of the credit it still enjoys, the",Elementary Forms
41360,animistic theory of the soul must be revised. It is true that to-day the,Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive attributes his dreams, or at least certain of them, to",Elementary Forms
41360,displacements of his double. But that does not say that the dream,Elementary Forms
41360,actually furnished the materials out of which the idea of the double or,Elementary Forms
41360,the soul was first constructed; it might have been applied afterwards to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the phenomena of dreams, ecstasy and possession, without having been",Elementary Forms
41360,"derived from them. It is very frequent that, after it has been formed,",Elementary Forms
41360,an idea is employed to co-ordinate or illuminate--with a light,Elementary Forms
41360,frequently more apparent than real--certain facts with which it had no,Elementary Forms
41360,"relation at first, and which would never have suggested it themselves.",Elementary Forms
41360,God and the immortality of the soul are frequently proven to-day by,Elementary Forms
41360,showing that these beliefs are implied in the fundamental principles of,Elementary Forms
41360,"morality; as a matter of fact, they have quite another origin. The",Elementary Forms
41360,history of religious thought could furnish numerous examples of these,Elementary Forms
41360,"retrospective justifications, which can teach us nothing of the way in",Elementary Forms
41360,"which the ideas were formed, nor of the elements out of which they are",Elementary Forms
41360,composed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is also probable that the primitive distinguishes between his dreams,",Elementary Forms
41360,and does not interpret them all in the same way. In our European,Elementary Forms
41360,societies the still numerous persons for whom sleep is a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,"magico-religious state in which the mind, being partially relieved of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body, has a sharpness of vision which it does not enjoy during",Elementary Forms
41360,"waking moments, do not go to the point of considering all their dreams",Elementary Forms
41360,"as so many mystic intuitions: on the contrary, along with everybody",Elementary Forms
41360,"else, they see in the majority of their dreams only profane conditions,",Elementary Forms
41360,"vain plays of images, or simple hallucinations. It might be supposed",Elementary Forms
41360,that the primitive should make analogous distinctions. Codrington says,Elementary Forms
41360,distinctly that the Melanesians do not attribute all their dreams,Elementary Forms
41360,"indiscriminately to the wanderings of their souls, but merely those",Elementary Forms
41360,which strike their imagination forcibly:[109] undoubtedly by that should,Elementary Forms
41360,be understood those in which the sleeper imagines himself in relations,Elementary Forms
41360,"with religious beings, good or evil geniuses, souls of the dead, etc.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Similarly, the Dieri in Australia sharply distinguish ordinary dreams",Elementary Forms
41360,from those nocturnal visions in which some deceased friend or relative,Elementary Forms
41360,"shows himself to them. In the first, they see a simple fantasy of their",Elementary Forms
41360,imagination; they attribute the second to the action of an evil,Elementary Forms
41360,spirit.[110] All the facts which Howitt mentions as examples to show how,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Australian attributes to the soul the power of leaving the body,",Elementary Forms
41360,have an equally mystic character. The sleeper believes himself,Elementary Forms
41360,transported into the land of the dead or else he converses with a dead,Elementary Forms
41360,companion.[111] These dreams are frequent among the primitives.[112] It,Elementary Forms
41360,is probably upon these facts that the theory is based. To account for,Elementary Forms
41360,"them, it is admitted that the souls of the dead come back to the living",Elementary Forms
41360,during their sleep. This theory was the more readily accepted because no,Elementary Forms
41360,fact of experience could invalidate it. But these dreams were possible,Elementary Forms
41360,"only where the ideas of spirits, souls and a land of the dead were",Elementary Forms
41360,"already existent, that is to say, where religious evolution was",Elementary Forms
41360,"relatively advanced. Thus, far from having been able to furnish to",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion the fundamental notion upon which it rests, they suppose a",Elementary Forms
41360,"previous religious system, upon which they depended.[113]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We now arrive at that which constitutes the very heart of the doctrine.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wherever this idea of a double may come from, it is not sufficient,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to the avowal of the animists themselves, to explain the",Elementary Forms
41360,formation of the cult of the ancestors which they would make the initial,Elementary Forms
41360,"type of all religions. If this double is to become the object of a cult,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it must cease to be a simple reproduction of the individual, and must",Elementary Forms
41360,acquire the characteristics necessary to put it in the rank of sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings. It is death, they say, which performs this transformation. But",Elementary Forms
41360,whence comes the virtue which they attribute to this? Even were the,Elementary Forms
41360,analogy of sleep and death sufficient to make one believe that the soul,Elementary Forms
41360,"survives the body (and there are reservations to be made on this point),",Elementary Forms
41360,"why does this soul, by the mere fact that it is now detached from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"organism, so completely change its nature? If it was only a profane",Elementary Forms
41360,"thing, a wandering vital principle, during life, how does it become a",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred thing all at once, and the object of religious sentiments? Death",Elementary Forms
41360,"adds nothing essential to it, except a greater liberty of movement.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Being no longer attached to a special residence, from now on, it can do",Elementary Forms
41360,at any time what it formerly did only by night; but the action of which,Elementary Forms
41360,it is capable is always of the same sort. Then why have the living,Elementary Forms
41360,considered this uprooted and vagabond double of their former companion,Elementary Forms
41360,"as anything more than an equal? It was a fellow-creature, whose approach",Elementary Forms
41360,might be inconvenient; it was not a divinity.[114],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It seems as though death ought to have the effect of weakening vital,Elementary Forms
41360,"energies, instead of strengthening them. It is, in fact, a very common",Elementary Forms
41360,belief in the inferior societies that the soul participates actively in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the life of the body. If the body is wounded, it is wounded itself and",Elementary Forms
41360,in a corresponding place. Then it should grow old along with the body.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, there are peoples who do not render funeral honours to men",Elementary Forms
41360,arrived at senility; they are treated as if their souls also had become,Elementary Forms
41360,"senile.[115] It even happens that they regularly put to death, before",Elementary Forms
41360,"they arrive at old age, certain privileged persons, such as kings or",Elementary Forms
41360,"priests, who are supposed to be the possessors of powerful spirits whose",Elementary Forms
41360,protection the community wishes to keep. They thus seek to keep the,Elementary Forms
41360,spirit from being affected by the physical decadence of its momentary,Elementary Forms
41360,"keepers; with this end in view, they take it from the organism where it",Elementary Forms
41360,"resides before age can have weakened it, and they transport it, while it",Elementary Forms
41360,"has as yet lost nothing of its vigour, into a younger body where it will",Elementary Forms
41360,be able to keep its vitality intact.[116] So when death results from,Elementary Forms
41360,"sickness or old age, it seems as though the soul could retain only a",Elementary Forms
41360,"diminished power; and if it is only its double, it is difficult to see",Elementary Forms
41360,"how it could survive at all, after the body is once definitely",Elementary Forms
41360,"dissolved. From this point of view, the idea of survival is intelligible",Elementary Forms
41360,only with great difficulty. There is a logical and psychological gap,Elementary Forms
41360,between the idea of a double at liberty and that of a spirit to which a,Elementary Forms
41360,cult is addressed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This interval appears still more considerable when we realize what an,Elementary Forms
41360,abyss separates the sacred world from the profane; it becomes evident,Elementary Forms
41360,that a simple change of degree could not be enough to make something,Elementary Forms
41360,pass from one category into the other. Sacred beings are not,Elementary Forms
41360,distinguished from profane ones merely by the strange or disconcerting,Elementary Forms
41360,forms which they take or by the greater powers which they enjoy; between,Elementary Forms
41360,the two there is no common measure. Now there is nothing in the notion,Elementary Forms
41360,of a double which could account for so radical a heterogeneity. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"said that when once freed from the body, the spirit can work all sorts",Elementary Forms
41360,"of good or evil for the living, according to the way in which it regards",Elementary Forms
41360,them. But it is not enough that a being should disturb his neighbourhood,Elementary Forms
41360,to seem to be of a wholly different nature from those whose tranquillity,Elementary Forms
41360,"it menaces. To be sure, in the sentiment which the believer feels for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the things he adores, there always enters in some element of reserve and",Elementary Forms
41360,"fear; but this is a fear _sui generis_, derived from respect more than",Elementary Forms
41360,"from fright, and where the dominating emotion is that which _la majeste_",Elementary Forms
41360,inspires in men. The idea of majesty is essentially religious. Then we,Elementary Forms
41360,have explained nothing of religion until we have found whence this idea,Elementary Forms
41360,"comes, to what it corresponds and what can have aroused it in the mind.",Elementary Forms
41360,Simple souls of men cannot become invested with this character by the,Elementary Forms
41360,simple fact of being no longer incarnate.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is clearly shown by an example from Melanesia. The Melanesians,Elementary Forms
41360,believe that men have souls which leave the body at death; it then,Elementary Forms
41360,"changes its name and becomes what they call a _tindalo_, a _natmat_,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc. Also, they have a cult of the souls of the dead: they pray to them,",Elementary Forms
41360,invoke them and make offerings and sacrifices to them. But every,Elementary Forms
41360,_tindalo_ is not the object of these ritual practices; only those have,Elementary Forms
41360,"this honour which come from men to whom public opinion attributed,",Elementary Forms
41360,"during life, the very special virtue which the Melanesians call the",Elementary Forms
41360,"_mana_. Later on, we shall have occasion to fix precisely the meaning",Elementary Forms
41360,"which this word expresses; for the time being, it will suffice to say",Elementary Forms
41360,that it is the distinctive character of every sacred being. As,Elementary Forms
41360,"Codrington says, ""it is what works to effect anything which is beyond",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ordinary power of men, outside the common processes of nature.""[117]",Elementary Forms
41360,"A priest, a sorcerer or a ritual formula have mana as well as a sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,stone or spirit. Thus the only tindalo to which religious services are,Elementary Forms
41360,"rendered are those which were already sacred of themselves, when their",Elementary Forms
41360,"proprietor was still alive. In regard to the other souls, which come",Elementary Forms
41360,"from ordinary men, from the crowd of the profane, the same author says",Elementary Forms
41360,"that they are ""nobodies alike before and after death.""[118] By itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,death has no deifying virtue. Since it brings about in a more or less,Elementary Forms
41360,complete and final fashion the separation of the soul from profane,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, it can well reinforce the sacred character of the soul, if this",Elementary Forms
41360,"already exists, but it cannot create it.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, if, as the hypothesis of the animists supposes, the first",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred beings were really the souls of the dead and the first cult that,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the ancestors, it should be found that the lower the societies",Elementary Forms
41360,"examined are, the more the place given to this cult in the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,life. But it is rather the contrary which is true. The ancestral cult is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not greatly developed, or even presented under a characteristic form,",Elementary Forms
41360,"except in advanced societies like those of China, Egypt or the Greek and",Elementary Forms
41360,"Latin cities; on the other hand, it is completely lacking in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian societies which, as we shall see, represent the lowest and",Elementary Forms
41360,simplest form of social organization which we know. It is true that,Elementary Forms
41360,funeral rites and rites of mourning are found there; but these practices,Elementary Forms
41360,"do not constitute a cult, though this name has sometimes wrongfully been",Elementary Forms
41360,"given them. In reality, a cult is not a simple group of ritual",Elementary Forms
41360,precautions which a man is held to take in certain circumstances; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"a system of diverse rites, festivals and ceremonies which _all have this",Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristic, that they reappear periodically_. They fulfil the need",Elementary Forms
41360,"which the believer feels of strengthening and reaffirming, at regular",Elementary Forms
41360,"intervals of time, the bond which unites him to the sacred beings upon",Elementary Forms
41360,which he depends. That is why one speaks of marriage rites but not of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"marriage cult, of rites of birth but not of a cult of the new-born",Elementary Forms
41360,child; it is because the events on the occasion of which these rites,Elementary Forms
41360,"take place imply no periodicity. In the same way, there is no cult of",Elementary Forms
41360,the ancestors except when sacrifices are made on the tombs from time to,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, when libations are poured there on certain more or less specific",Elementary Forms
41360,"dates, or when festivals are regularly celebrated in honour of the dead.",Elementary Forms
41360,But the Australian has no relations of this sort with his dead. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"true that he must bury their remains according to a ritual, mourn for",Elementary Forms
41360,"them during a prescribed length of time and in a prescribed manner, and",Elementary Forms
41360,revenge them if there is occasion to.[119] But when he has once,Elementary Forms
41360,"accomplished these pious tasks, when the bones are once dry and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"period of mourning is once accomplished, then all is said and done, and",Elementary Forms
41360,the survivors have no more duties towards their relatives who exist no,Elementary Forms
41360,longer. It is true that there is a way in which the dead continue to,Elementary Forms
41360,"hold a place in the lives of their kindred, even after the mourning is",Elementary Forms
41360,finished. It is sometimes the case that their hair or certain of their,Elementary Forms
41360,"bones are kept, because of special virtues which are attached to",Elementary Forms
41360,"them.[120] But by that time they have ceased to exist as persons, and",Elementary Forms
41360,have fallen to the rank of anonymous and impersonal charms. In this,Elementary Forms
41360,condition they are the object of no cult; they serve only for magical,Elementary Forms
41360,purposes.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, there are certain Australian tribes which periodically",Elementary Forms
41360,celebrate rites in honour of fabulous ancestors whom tradition places at,Elementary Forms
41360,the beginning of time. These ceremonies generally consist in a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,dramatic representation in which are rehearsed the deeds which the myths,Elementary Forms
41360,ascribe to these legendary heroes.[121] But the personages thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented are not men who, after living the life of men, have been",Elementary Forms
41360,transformed into a sort of god by the fact of their death. They are,Elementary Forms
41360,considered to have exercised superhuman powers while alive. To them is,Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed all that is grand in the history of the tribe, or even of the",Elementary Forms
41360,whole world. It is they who in a large measure made the earth such as it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is, and men such as they are. The haloes with which they are still",Elementary Forms
41360,decorated do not come to them merely from the fact that they are,Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestors, that is to say, in fine, that they are dead, but rather from",Elementary Forms
41360,the fact that a divine character is and always has been attributed to,Elementary Forms
41360,"them; to use the Melanesian expression, it is because they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"constitutionally endowed with mana. Consequently, there is nothing in",Elementary Forms
41360,these rites which shows that death has the slightest power of,Elementary Forms
41360,deification. It cannot even be correctly said of certain rites that they,Elementary Forms
41360,"form an ancestor-cult, since they are not addressed to ancestors as",Elementary Forms
41360,"such. In order to have a real cult of the dead, it is necessary that",Elementary Forms
41360,"after death real ancestors, the relations whom men really lose every",Elementary Forms
41360,"day, become the object of the cult; let us repeat it once more, there",Elementary Forms
41360,are no traces of any such cult in Australia.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus the cult which, according to this hypothesis, ought to be the",Elementary Forms
41360,"predominating one in inferior societies, is really nonexistent there. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality, the Australian is not concerned with his dead, except at the",Elementary Forms
41360,moment of their decease and during the time which immediately follows.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yet these same peoples, as we shall see, have a very complex cult for",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred beings of a wholly different nature, which is made up of numerous",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies and frequently occupying weeks or even entire months. It,Elementary Forms
41360,cannot be admitted that the few rites which the Australian performs when,Elementary Forms
41360,he happens to lose one of his relatives were the origin of these,Elementary Forms
41360,permanent cults which return regularly every year and which take up a,Elementary Forms
41360,considerable part of his existence. The contrast between the two is so,Elementary Forms
41360,great that we may even ask whether the first were not rather derived,Elementary Forms
41360,"from the second, and if the souls of men, far from having been the model",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which the gods were originally imagined, have not rather been",Elementary Forms
41360,conceived from the very first as emanations from the divinity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From the moment that the cult of the dead is shown not to be primitive,",Elementary Forms
41360,animism lacks a basis. It would then seem useless to discuss the third,Elementary Forms
41360,"thesis of the system, which concerns the transformation of the cult of",Elementary Forms
41360,the dead into the cult of nature. But since the postulate upon which it,Elementary Forms
41360,rests is also found in certain historians of religion who do not admit,Elementary Forms
41360,"the animism properly so-called, such as Brinton,[122] Lang,[123]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Reville,[124] and even Robertson Smith himself,[125] it is necessary to",Elementary Forms
41360,make an examination of it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This extension of the cult of the dead to all nature is said to come,Elementary Forms
41360,from the fact that we instinctively tend to represent all things in our,Elementary Forms
41360,"own image, that is to say, as living and thinking beings. We have seen",Elementary Forms
41360,that Spencer has already contested the reality of this so-called,Elementary Forms
41360,instinct. Since animals clearly distinguish living bodies from dead,Elementary Forms
41360,"ones, it seemed to him impossible that man, the heir of the animals,",Elementary Forms
41360,should not have had this same faculty of discernment from the very,Elementary Forms
41360,"first. But howsoever certain the facts cited by Spencer may be, they",Elementary Forms
41360,have not the demonstrative value which he attributes to them. His,Elementary Forms
41360,"reasoning supposes that all the faculties, instincts and aptitudes of",Elementary Forms
41360,the animal have passed integrally into man; now many errors have their,Elementary Forms
41360,origin in this principle which is wrongfully taken as a proven truth.,Elementary Forms
41360,"For example, since sexual jealousy is generally very strong among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"higher animals, it has been concluded that it ought to be found among",Elementary Forms
41360,men with the same intensity from the very beginnings of history.[126],Elementary Forms
41360,But it is well known to-day that men can practise a sexual communism,Elementary Forms
41360,which would be impossible if this jealousy were not capable of,Elementary Forms
41360,attenuating itself and even of disappearing when necessary.[127] The,Elementary Forms
41360,fact is that man is not merely an animal with certain additional,Elementary Forms
41360,qualities: he is something else. Human nature is the result of a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,"recasting of the animal nature, and in the course of the various complex",Elementary Forms
41360,"operations which have brought about this recasting, there have been",Elementary Forms
41360,losses as well as gains. How many instincts have we not lost? The reason,Elementary Forms
41360,for this is that men are not only in relations with the physical,Elementary Forms
41360,"environment, but also with a social environment infinitely more",Elementary Forms
41360,"extended, more stable and more active than the one whose influence",Elementary Forms
41360,"animals undergo. To live, they must adapt themselves to this. Now in",Elementary Forms
41360,"order to maintain itself, society frequently finds it necessary that we",Elementary Forms
41360,should see things from a certain angle and feel them in a certain way;,Elementary Forms
41360,consequently it modifies the ideas which we would ordinarily make of,Elementary Forms
41360,them for ourselves and the sentiments to which we would be inclined if,Elementary Forms
41360,"we listened only to our animal nature; it alters them, even going so far",Elementary Forms
41360,as to put the contrary sentiments in their place. Does it not even go so,Elementary Forms
41360,far as to make us regard our own individual lives as something of little,Elementary Forms
41360,"value, while for the animal this is the greatest of things?[128] Then it",Elementary Forms
41360,is a vain enterprise to seek to infer the mental constitution of the,Elementary Forms
41360,primitive man from that of the higher animals.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if the objection of Spencer does not have the decisive value which,Elementary Forms
41360,"its author gives it, it is equally true that the animist theory can draw",Elementary Forms
41360,no authority from the confusions which children seem to make. When we,Elementary Forms
41360,"hear a child angrily apostrophize an object which he has hit against, we",Elementary Forms
41360,conclude that he thinks of it as a conscious being like himself; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"that is interpreting his words and acts very badly. In reality, he is",Elementary Forms
41360,quite a stranger to the very complicated reasoning attributed to him. If,Elementary Forms
41360,"he lays the blame on the table which has hurt him, it is not because he",Elementary Forms
41360,"supposes it animated and intelligent, but because it has hurt him. His",Elementary Forms
41360,"anger, once aroused by the pain, must overflow; so it looks for",Elementary Forms
41360,"something upon which to discharge itself, and naturally turns toward the",Elementary Forms
41360,"thing which has provoked it, even though this has no effect. The action",Elementary Forms
41360,of an adult in similar circumstances is often as slightly reasonable.,Elementary Forms
41360,"When we are violently irritated, we feel the need of inveighing, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"destroying, though we attribute no conscious ill-will to the objects",Elementary Forms
41360,upon which we vent our anger. There is even so little confusion that,Elementary Forms
41360,"when the emotion of a child is calmed, he can very well distinguish a",Elementary Forms
41360,chair from a person: he does not act in at all the same way towards the,Elementary Forms
41360,two. It is a similar reason which explains his tendency to treat his,Elementary Forms
41360,playthings as if they were living beings. It is his extremely intense,Elementary Forms
41360,"need of playing which thus finds a means of expressing itself, just as",Elementary Forms
41360,in the other case the violent sentiments caused by pain created an,Elementary Forms
41360,object out of nothing. In order that he may consciously play with his,Elementary Forms
41360,"jumping-jack, he imagines it a living person. This illusion is the",Elementary Forms
41360,easier for him because imagination is his sovereign mistress; he thinks,Elementary Forms
41360,"almost entirely with images, and we know how pliant images are, bending",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves with docility before every exigency of the will. But he is so,Elementary Forms
41360,little deceived by his own fiction that he would be the first to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"surprised if it suddenly became a reality, and his toy bit him![129]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Let us therefore leave these doubtful analogies to one side. To find out,Elementary Forms
41360,"if men were primitively inclined to the confusions imputed to them, we",Elementary Forms
41360,"should not study animals or children of to-day, but the primitive",Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs themselves. If the spirits and gods of nature were really formed,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the image of the human soul, they should bear traces of their origin",Elementary Forms
41360,and bring to mind the essential traits of their model. The most,Elementary Forms
41360,important characteristic of the soul is that it is conceived as the,Elementary Forms
41360,internal principle which animates the organism: it is that which moves,Elementary Forms
41360,"it and makes it live, to such an extent that when it withdraws itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"life ceases or is suspended. It has its natural residence in the body,",Elementary Forms
41360,at least while this exists. But it is not thus with the spirits assigned,Elementary Forms
41360,to the different things in nature. The god of the sun is not necessarily,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the sun, nor is the spirit of a certain rock in the rock which is its",Elementary Forms
41360,principal place of habitation. A spirit undoubtedly has close relations,Elementary Forms
41360,"with the body to which it is attached, but one employs a very inexact",Elementary Forms
41360,"expression when he says that it is its soul. As Codrington says,[130]",Elementary Forms
41360,"""there does not appear to be anywhere in Melanesia a belief in a spirit",Elementary Forms
41360,"which animates any natural object, a tree, waterfall, storm or rock, so",Elementary Forms
41360,as to be to it what the soul is believed to be to the body of man.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Europeans, it is true, speak of the spirits of the sea or of the storm",Elementary Forms
41360,or of the forest; but the native idea which they represent is that,Elementary Forms
41360,"ghosts haunt the sea and the forest, having power to raise storms and",Elementary Forms
41360,"strike a traveller with disease."" While the soul is essentially within",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body, the spirit passes the major portion of its time outside the",Elementary Forms
41360,object which serves as its base. This is one difference which does not,Elementary Forms
41360,seem to show that the second idea was derived from the first.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From another point of view, it must be added that if men were really",Elementary Forms
41360,"forced to project their own image into things, then the first sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,beings ought to have been conceived in their likeness. Now,Elementary Forms
41360,"anthropomorphism, far from being primitive, is rather the mark of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"relatively advanced civilization. In the beginning, sacred beings are",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived in the form of an animal or vegetable, from which the human",Elementary Forms
41360,"form is only slowly disengaged. It will be seen below that in Australia,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is animals and plants which are the first sacred beings. Even among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Indians of North America, the great cosmic divinities, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"commence to be the object of a cult there, are very frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"represented in animal forms.[131] ""The difference between the animal,",Elementary Forms
41360,"man and the divine being,"" says Reville, not without surprise, ""is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"felt in this state of mind, and generally it might be said that _it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal form which is the fundamental one_.""[132] To find a god made",Elementary Forms
41360,"up entirely of human elements, it is necessary to advance nearly to",Elementary Forms
41360,"Christianity. Here, God is a man, not only in the physical aspect in",Elementary Forms
41360,"which he is temporarily made manifest, but also in the ideas and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiments which he expresses. But even in Greece and Rome, though the",Elementary Forms
41360,"gods were generally represented with human traits, many mythical",Elementary Forms
41360,"personages still had traces of an animal origin: thus there is Dionysus,",Elementary Forms
41360,"who is often met with in the form of a bull, or at least with the horns",Elementary Forms
41360,"of a bull; there is Demeter, who is often represented with a horse's",Elementary Forms
41360,"mane, there are Pan and Silenus, there are the Fauns, etc.[133] It is",Elementary Forms
41360,not at all true that man has had such an inclination to impose his own,Elementary Forms
41360,"form upon things. More than that, he even commenced by conceiving of",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself as participating closely in the animal nature. In fact, it is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"belief almost universal in Australia, and very widespread among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Indians of North America, that the ancestors of men were beasts or",Elementary Forms
41360,"plants, or at least that the first men had, either in whole or in part,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the distinctive characters of certain animal or vegetable species. Thus,",Elementary Forms
41360,"far from seeing beings like themselves everywhere, men commenced by",Elementary Forms
41360,believing themselves to be in the image of some beings from which they,Elementary Forms
41360,differed radically.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, the animistic theory implies a consequence which is perhaps its",Elementary Forms
41360,best refutation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If it were true, it would be necessary to admit that religious beliefs",Elementary Forms
41360,"are so many hallucinatory representations, without any objective",Elementary Forms
41360,foundation whatsoever. It is supposed that they are all derived from the,Elementary Forms
41360,idea of the soul because one sees only a magnified soul in the spirits,Elementary Forms
41360,"and gods. But according to Tylor and his disciples, the idea of the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,is itself constructed entirely out of the vague and inconsistent images,Elementary Forms
41360,"which occupy our attention during sleep: for the soul is the double, and",Elementary Forms
41360,the double is merely a man as he appears to himself while he sleeps.,Elementary Forms
41360,"From this point of view, then, sacred beings are only the imaginary",Elementary Forms
41360,conceptions which men have produced during a sort of delirium which,Elementary Forms
41360,"regularly overtakes them every day, though it is quite impossible to see",Elementary Forms
41360,"to what useful ends these conceptions serve, nor what they answer to in",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality. If a man prays, if he makes sacrifices and offerings, if he",Elementary Forms
41360,"submits to the multiple privations which the ritual prescribes, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,because a sort of constitutional eccentricity has made him take his,Elementary Forms
41360,"dreams for perceptions, death for a prolonged sleep, and dead bodies for",Elementary Forms
41360,"living and thinking beings. Thus not only is it true, as many have held,",Elementary Forms
41360,that the forms under which religious powers have been represented to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mind do not express them exactly, and that the symbols with the aid of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which they have been thought of partially hide their real nature, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"more than that, behind these images and figures there exists nothing but",Elementary Forms
41360,"the nightmares of primitive minds. In fine, religion is nothing but a",Elementary Forms
41360,"dream, systematized and lived, but without any foundation in",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality.[134] Thence it comes about that the theorists of animism, when",Elementary Forms
41360,"looking for the origins of religious thought, content themselves with a",Elementary Forms
41360,small outlay of energy. When they think that they have explained how men,Elementary Forms
41360,"have been induced to imagine beings of a strange, vaporous form, such as",Elementary Forms
41360,"those they see in their dreams, they think the problem is resolved.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In reality, it is not even approached. It is inadmissible that systems",Elementary Forms
41360,"of ideas like religions, which have held so considerable a place in",Elementary Forms
41360,"history, and to which, in all times, men have come to receive the energy",Elementary Forms
41360,"which they must have to live, should be made up of a tissue of",Elementary Forms
41360,"illusions. To-day we are beginning to realize that law, morals and even",Elementary Forms
41360,"scientific thought itself were born of religion, were for a long time",Elementary Forms
41360,"confounded with it, and have remained penetrated with its spirit. How",Elementary Forms
41360,could a vain fantasy have been able to fashion the human consciousness,Elementary Forms
41360,so strongly and so durably? Surely it ought to be a principle of the,Elementary Forms
41360,science of religions that religion expresses nothing which does not,Elementary Forms
41360,exist in nature; for there are sciences only of natural phenomena. The,Elementary Forms
41360,only question is to learn from what part of nature these realities come,Elementary Forms
41360,and what has been able to make men represent them under this singular,Elementary Forms
41360,form which is peculiar to religious thought. But if this question is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"be raised, it is necessary to commence by admitting that they are real",Elementary Forms
41360,things which are thus represented. When the philosophers of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"eighteenth century made religion a vast error imagined by the priests,",Elementary Forms
41360,they could at least explain its persistence by the interest which the,Elementary Forms
41360,sacerdotal class had in deceiving the people. But if the people,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves have been the artisans of these systems of erroneous ideas at,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same time that they were its dupes, how has this extraordinary",Elementary Forms
41360,dupery been able to perpetuate itself all through the course of history?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One might even demand if under these conditions the words of science of,Elementary Forms
41360,religions can be employed without impropriety. A science is a discipline,Elementary Forms
41360,"which, in whatever manner it is conceived, is always applied to some",Elementary Forms
41360,real data. Physics and chemistry are sciences because physico-chemical,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena are real, and of a reality which does not depend upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,truths which these sciences show. There is a psychological science,Elementary Forms
41360,because there are really consciousnesses which do not hold their right,Elementary Forms
41360,"of existence from the psychologist. But on the contrary, religion could",Elementary Forms
41360,not survive the animistic theory and the day when its truth was,Elementary Forms
41360,"recognized by men, for they could not fail to renounce the errors whose",Elementary Forms
41360,nature and origin would thus be revealed to them. What sort of a science,Elementary Forms
41360,is it whose principal discovery is that the subject of which it treats,Elementary Forms
41360,does not exist?,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The spirit of the naturistic school is quite different. In the first,Elementary Forms
41360,"place, it is recruited in a different environment. The animists are, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the most part, ethnologists or anthropologists. The religions which they",Elementary Forms
41360,have studied are the crudest which humanity has ever known. Hence comes,Elementary Forms
41360,the extraordinary importance which they attribute to the souls of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"dead, to spirits and to demons, and, in fact, to all spiritual beings of",Elementary Forms
41360,the second order: it is because these religions know hardly any of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"higher order.[135] On the contrary, the theories which we are now going",Elementary Forms
41360,to describe are the work of scholars who have concerned themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,especially with the great civilizations of Europe and Asia.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Ever since the work of the Grimm brothers, who pointed out the interest",Elementary Forms
41360,that there is in comparing the different mythologies of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Indo-European peoples, scholars have been struck by the remarkable",Elementary Forms
41360,similarities which these present. Mythical personages were identified,Elementary Forms
41360,"who, though having different names, symbolized the same ideas and",Elementary Forms
41360,"fulfilled the same functions; even the names were frequently related,",Elementary Forms
41360,and it has been thought possible to establish the fact that they are not,Elementary Forms
41360,unconnected with one another. Such resemblances seemed to be explicable,Elementary Forms
41360,only by a common origin. Thus they were led to suppose that these,Elementary Forms
41360,"conceptions, so varied in appearance, really came from one common",Elementary Forms
41360,"source, of which they were only diversified forms, and which it was not",Elementary Forms
41360,"impossible to discover. By the comparative method, they believed one",Elementary Forms
41360,"should be able to go back, beyond these great religions, to a much more",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancient system of ideas, and to the really primitive religion, from",Elementary Forms
41360,which the others were derived.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The discovery of the Vedas aided greatly in stimulating these ambitions.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the Vedas, scholars had a written text, whose antiquity was",Elementary Forms
41360,"undoubtedly exaggerated at the moment of its discovery, but which is",Elementary Forms
41360,surely one of the most ancient which we have at our disposition in an,Elementary Forms
41360,"Indo-European language. Here they were enabled to study, by the ordinary",Elementary Forms
41360,"methods of philology, a literature as old as or older than Homer, and a",Elementary Forms
41360,religion which was believed more primitive than that of the ancient,Elementary Forms
41360,Germans. A document of such value was evidently destined to throw a new,Elementary Forms
41360,"light upon the religious beginnings of humanity, and the science of",Elementary Forms
41360,religions could not fail to be revolutionized by it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The conception which was thus born was so fully demanded by the state of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the science and by the general march of ideas, that it appeared almost",Elementary Forms
41360,"simultaneously in two different lands. In 1856, Max Mueller exposed its",Elementary Forms
41360,principles in his _Oxford Essays_.[136] Three years later appeared the,Elementary Forms
41360,work of Adalbert Kuhn on _The Origin of Fire and the Drink of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Gods_,[137] which was clearly inspired by the same spirit. When once set",Elementary Forms
41360,"forth, the idea spread very rapidly in scientific circles. To the name",Elementary Forms
41360,"of Kuhn is closely associated that of his brother-in-law Schwartz, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"work on _The Origin of Mythology_,[138] followed closely upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,preceding one. Steinthal and the whole German school of,Elementary Forms
41360,_Voelkerpsychologie_ attached themselves to the same movement. The theory,Elementary Forms
41360,was introduced into France in 1863 by M. Michel Breal.[139] It met so,Elementary Forms
41360,"little resistance that, according to an expression of Gruppe,[140] ""a",Elementary Forms
41360,"time came when, aside from certain classical philologists, to whom Vedic",Elementary Forms
41360,"studies were unknown, all the mythologists had adopted the principles of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Max Mueller or Kuhn as their point of departure.""[141] It is therefore",Elementary Forms
41360,"important to see what they really are, and what they are worth.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Since no one has presented them in a more systematic form than Max,Elementary Forms
41360,"Mueller, it is upon his work that we shall base the description which",Elementary Forms
41360,follows.[142],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have seen that the postulate at the basis of animism is that,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, at least in its origin, expresses no physical reality. But Max",Elementary Forms
41360,"Mueller commences with the contrary principle. For him, it is an axiom",Elementary Forms
41360,"that religion reposes upon an experience, from which it draws all its",Elementary Forms
41360,"authority. ""Religion,"" he says, ""if it is to hold its place as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"legitimate element of our consciousness, must, like all other knowledge,",Elementary Forms
41360,"begin with sensuous experience.""[143] Taking up the old empirical adage,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""_Nihil est in intellectu quod non ante fuerit in sensu_,"" he applies it",Elementary Forms
41360,to religion and declares that there can be nothing in beliefs which was,Elementary Forms
41360,not first perceived. So here is a doctrine which seems to escape the,Elementary Forms
41360,grave objection which we raised against animism. From this point of,Elementary Forms
41360,"view, it seems that religion ought to appear, not as a sort of vague and",Elementary Forms
41360,"confused dreaming, but as a system of ideas and practices well founded",Elementary Forms
41360,in reality.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But which are these sensations which give birth to religious thought?,Elementary Forms
41360,That is the question which the study of the Vedas is supposed to aid in,Elementary Forms
41360,resolving.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The names of the gods are generally either common words, still employed,",Elementary Forms
41360,"or else words formerly common, whose original sense it is possible to",Elementary Forms
41360,discover. Now both designate the principal phenomena of nature. Thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"_Agni_, the name of one of the principal divinities of India, originally",Elementary Forms
41360,"signified only the material fact of fire, such as it is ordinarily",Elementary Forms
41360,perceived by the senses and without any mythological addition. Even in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Vedas, it is still employed with this meaning; in any case, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,well shown that this signification was primitive by the fact that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"conserved in other Indo-European languages: the Latin _ignis_, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Lithuanian _ugnis_, the old Slav _ogny_ are evidently closely related to",Elementary Forms
41360,"Agni. Similarly, the relationship of the Sanskrit _Dyaus_, the Greek",Elementary Forms
41360,"_Zeus_, the Latin _Jovis_ and the _Zio_ of High German is to-day",Elementary Forms
41360,uncontested. This proves that these different words designate one single,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the same divinity, whom the different Indo-European peoples",Elementary Forms
41360,recognized as such before their separation. Now Dyaus signifies the,Elementary Forms
41360,bright sky. These and other similar facts tend to show that among these,Elementary Forms
41360,peoples the forms and forces of nature were the first objects to which,Elementary Forms
41360,the religious sentiment attached itself: they were the first things to,Elementary Forms
41360,"be deified. Going one step farther in his generalization, Max Mueller",Elementary Forms
41360,thought that he was prepared to conclude that the religious evolution of,Elementary Forms
41360,humanity in general had the same point of departure.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is almost entirely by considerations of a psychological sort that he,Elementary Forms
41360,justifies these inferences. The varied spectacles which nature offers,Elementary Forms
41360,man seemed to him to fulfil all the conditions necessary for arousing,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious ideas in the mind directly. In fact, he says, ""at first sight,",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing seemed less natural than nature. Nature was the greatest,Elementary Forms
41360,"surprise, a terror, a marvel, a standing miracle, and it was only on",Elementary Forms
41360,"account of their permanence, constancy, and regular recurrence that",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain features of that standing miracle were called natural, in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sense of foreseen, common, intelligible.... It was that vast domain of",Elementary Forms
41360,"surprise, of terror, of marvel, of miracle, the unknown, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguished from the known, or, as I like to express it, the infinite,",Elementary Forms
41360,"as distinct from the finite, which supplied from the earliest times the",Elementary Forms
41360,"impulse to religious thought and language.""[144] In order to illustrate",Elementary Forms
41360,"his idea, he applies it to a natural force which holds a rather large",Elementary Forms
41360,"place in the Vedic religion, fire. He says, ""if you can for a moment",Elementary Forms
41360,transfer yourselves to that early stage of life to which we must refer,Elementary Forms
41360,"not only the origin, but likewise the early phases of Physical Religion,",Elementary Forms
41360,you can easily understand what an impression the first appearance of,Elementary Forms
41360,fire must have made on the human mind. Fire was not given as something,Elementary Forms
41360,"permanent or eternal, like the sky, or the earth, or the water. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"whatever way it first appeared, whether through lightning or through the",Elementary Forms
41360,"friction of the branches of trees, or through the sparks of flints, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"came and went, it had to be guarded, it brought destruction, but at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, it made life possible in winter, it served as a protection",Elementary Forms
41360,"during the night, it became a weapon of defence and offence, and last,",Elementary Forms
41360,"not least, it changed man from a devourer of raw flesh into an eater of",Elementary Forms
41360,"cooked meat. At a later time it became the means of working metal, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"making tools and weapons, it became an indispensable factor in all",Elementary Forms
41360,"mechanical and artistic progress, and has remained so ever since. What",Elementary Forms
41360,"should we be without fire even now?""[145] The same author says in",Elementary Forms
41360,another work that a man could not enter into relations with nature,Elementary Forms
41360,"without taking account of its immensity, of its infiniteness. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"surpasses him in every way. Beyond the distances which he perceives,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are others which extend without limits; each moment of time is,Elementary Forms
41360,preceded and followed by a time to which no limit can be assigned; the,Elementary Forms
41360,"flowing river manifests an infinite force, since nothing can exhaust",Elementary Forms
41360,it.[146] There is no aspect of nature which is not fitted to awaken,Elementary Forms
41360,within us this overwhelming sensation of an infinity which surrounds us,Elementary Forms
41360,and dominates us.[147] It is from this sensation that religions are,Elementary Forms
41360,derived.[148],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, they are there only in germ.[149] Religion really commences",Elementary Forms
41360,only at the moment when these natural forces are no longer represented,Elementary Forms
41360,in the mind in an abstract form. They must be transformed into personal,Elementary Forms
41360,"agents, living and thinking beings, spiritual powers or gods; for it is",Elementary Forms
41360,to beings of this sort that the cult is generally addressed. We have,Elementary Forms
41360,"seen that animism itself has been obliged to raise this question, and",Elementary Forms
41360,also how it has answered it: man seems to have a sort of native,Elementary Forms
41360,incapacity for distinguishing the animate from the inanimate and an,Elementary Forms
41360,irresistible tendency to conceive the second under the form of the,Elementary Forms
41360,first. Max Mueller rejects any such solution.[150] According to him it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"language which has brought about this metamorphosis, by the action which",Elementary Forms
41360,it exercises upon thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is easily explained how men, being perplexed by the marvellous forces",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which they feel that they depend, have been led to reflect upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, and how they have asked themselves what these forces are and have",Elementary Forms
41360,made an effort to substitute for the obscure sensation which they,Elementary Forms
41360,"primitively had of them, a clearer idea and a better defined concept.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But as our author very justly says,[151] this idea and concept are",Elementary Forms
41360,impossible without the word. Language is not merely the external,Elementary Forms
41360,covering of a thought; it also is its internal framework. It does not,Elementary Forms
41360,confine itself to expressing this thought after it has once been formed;,Elementary Forms
41360,"it also aids in making it. However, its nature is of a different sort,",Elementary Forms
41360,so its laws are not those of thought. Then since it contributes to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"elaboration of this latter, it cannot fail to do it violence to some",Elementary Forms
41360,"extent, and to deform it. It is a deformation of this sort which is said",Elementary Forms
41360,to have created the special characteristic of religious thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thinking consists in arranging our ideas, and consequently in",Elementary Forms
41360,"classifying them. To think of fire, for example, is to put it into a",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain category of things, in such a way as to be able to say that it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is this or that, or this and not that. But classifying is also naming,",Elementary Forms
41360,for a general idea has no existence and reality except in and by the,Elementary Forms
41360,word which expresses it and which alone makes its individuality. Thus,Elementary Forms
41360,the language of a people always has an influence upon the manner in,Elementary Forms
41360,"which new things, recently learned, are classified in the mind and are",Elementary Forms
41360,subsequently thought of; these new things are thus forced to adapt,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves to pre-existing forms. For this reason, the language which",Elementary Forms
41360,men spoke when they undertook to construct an elaborated representation,Elementary Forms
41360,of the universe marked the system of ideas which was then born with an,Elementary Forms
41360,indelible trace.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nor are we without some knowledge of this language, at least in so far",Elementary Forms
41360,as the Indo-European peoples are concerned. Howsoever distant it may be,Elementary Forms
41360,"from us, souvenirs of it remain in our actual languages which permit us",Elementary Forms
41360,"to imagine what it was: these are the roots. These stems, from which are",Elementary Forms
41360,derived all the words which we employ and which are found at the basis,Elementary Forms
41360,"of all the Indo-European languages, are regarded by Max Mueller as so",Elementary Forms
41360,many echoes of the language which the corresponding peoples spoke before,Elementary Forms
41360,"their separation, that is to say, at the very moment when this religion",Elementary Forms
41360,"of nature, which is to be explained, was being formed. Now these roots",Elementary Forms
41360,"present two remarkable characteristics, which, it is true, have as yet",Elementary Forms
41360,"been observed only in this particular group of languages, but which our",Elementary Forms
41360,author believes to be present equally in the other linguistic,Elementary Forms
41360,families.[152],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, the roots are general; that is to say that they do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not express particular things and individuals, but types, and even types",Elementary Forms
41360,of an extreme generality. They represent the most general themes of,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought; one finds there, as though fixed and crystallized, those",Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental categories of the intellect which at every moment in history,Elementary Forms
41360,"dominate the entire mental life, the arrangement of which philosophers",Elementary Forms
41360,have many times attempted to reconstruct.[153],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Secondly, the types to which they correspond are types of action, and",Elementary Forms
41360,not of objects. They translate the most general manners of acting which,Elementary Forms
41360,are to be observed among living beings and especially among men; they,Elementary Forms
41360,"are such actions as striking, pushing, rubbing, lying down, getting up,",Elementary Forms
41360,"pressing, mounting, descending, walking, etc. In other words, men",Elementary Forms
41360,generalized and named their principal ways of acting before generalizing,Elementary Forms
41360,and naming the phenomena of nature.[154],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Owing to their extreme generality, these words could easily be extended",Elementary Forms
41360,to all sorts of objects which they did not originally include; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,even this extreme suppleness which has permitted them to give birth to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the numerous words which are derived from them. Then when men, turning",Elementary Forms
41360,"towards things, undertook to name them, that they might be able to think",Elementary Forms
41360,"about them, they applied these words to them, though they were in no way",Elementary Forms
41360,"designed for them. But, owing to their origin, these were able to",Elementary Forms
41360,designate the forces of nature only by means of their manifestations,Elementary Forms
41360,which seemed the nearest to human actions: a thunderbolt was called,Elementary Forms
41360,"_something_ that tears up the soil or that spreads fire; the wind,",Elementary Forms
41360,"_something_ that sighs or whistles; the sun, _something_ that throws",Elementary Forms
41360,"golden arrows across space; a river, _something_ that flows, etc. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"since natural phenomena were thus compared to human acts, this",Elementary Forms
41360,_something_ to which they were attached was necessarily conceived under,Elementary Forms
41360,"the form of personal agents, more or less like men. It was only a",Elementary Forms
41360,"metaphor, but it was taken literally; the error was inevitable, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"science, which alone could dispel the illusion, did not yet exist. In a",Elementary Forms
41360,"word, since language was made of human elements, translating human",Elementary Forms
41360,"states, it could not be applied to nature without transforming it.[155]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Even to-day, remarks M. Breal, it forces us in a certain measure to",Elementary Forms
41360,"represent things from this angle. ""We do not express an idea, even one",Elementary Forms
41360,"designating a simple quality, without giving it a gender, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, a sex; we cannot speak of an object, even though it be considered",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a most general fashion, without determining it by an article; every",Elementary Forms
41360,"subject of a sentence is presented as an active being, every idea as an",Elementary Forms
41360,"action, and every action, be it transitory or permanent, is limited in",Elementary Forms
41360,"its duration by the tense in which we put the verb.""[156] Our scientific",Elementary Forms
41360,training enables us to rectify the errors which language might thus,Elementary Forms
41360,suggest to us; but the influence of the word ought to be all-powerful,Elementary Forms
41360,when it has no check. Language thus superimposes upon the material,Elementary Forms
41360,"world, such as it is revealed to our senses, a new world, composed",Elementary Forms
41360,wholly of spiritual beings which it has created out of nothing and which,Elementary Forms
41360,have been considered as the causes determining physical phenomena ever,Elementary Forms
41360,since.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But its action does not stop there. When words were once forged to,Elementary Forms
41360,represent these personalities which the popular imagination had placed,Elementary Forms
41360,"behind things, a reaction affected these words themselves: they raised",Elementary Forms
41360,"all sorts of questions, and it was to resolve these problems that myths",Elementary Forms
41360,were invented. It happened that one object received a plurality of,Elementary Forms
41360,"names, corresponding to the plurality of aspects under which it was",Elementary Forms
41360,presented in experience; thus there are more than twenty words in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Vedas for the sky. Since these words were different, it was believed",Elementary Forms
41360,that they corresponded to so many distinct personalities. But at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, it was strongly felt that these same personalities had an air",Elementary Forms
41360,"of relationship. To account for that, it was imagined that they formed a",Elementary Forms
41360,"single family; genealogies, a civil condition and a history were",Elementary Forms
41360,"invented for them. In other cases, different things were designated by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same term: to explain these homonyms, it was believed that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponding things were transformations of each other, and new",Elementary Forms
41360,fictions were invented to make these metamorphoses intelligible. Or,Elementary Forms
41360,"again, a word which had ceased to be understood, was the origin of",Elementary Forms
41360,fables designed to give it a meaning. The creative work of language,Elementary Forms
41360,"continued then, making constructions ever more and more complex, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"then mythology came to endow each god with a biography, ever more and",Elementary Forms
41360,"more extended and complete, the result of all of which was that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"divine personalities, at first confounded with things, finally",Elementary Forms
41360,distinguished and determined themselves.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is how the notion of the divine is said to have been constructed.,Elementary Forms
41360,"As for the religion of ancestors, it was only a reflection of this",Elementary Forms
41360,other.[157] The idea of the soul is said to have been first formed for,Elementary Forms
41360,"reasons somewhat analogous to those given by Tylor, except that",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to Max Mueller, they were designed to account for death, rather",Elementary Forms
41360,"than for dreams.[158] Then, under the influence of diverse, partially",Elementary Forms
41360,"accidental, circumstances,[159] the souls of men, being once disengaged",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the body, were drawn little by little within the circle of divine",Elementary Forms
41360,"beings, and were thus finally deified themselves. But this new cult was",Elementary Forms
41360,the product of only a secondary formation. This is proven by the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"that deified men have generally been imperfect gods or demi-gods, whom",Elementary Forms
41360,the people have always been able to distinguish from the genuine,Elementary Forms
41360,deities.[160],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This doctrine rests, in part, upon a certain number of linguistic",Elementary Forms
41360,postulates which have been and still are very much questioned. Some have,Elementary Forms
41360,contested the reality of many of the similarities which Max Mueller,Elementary Forms
41360,claimed to have found between the names of the gods in the various,Elementary Forms
41360,European languages. The interpretation which he gave them has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"especially doubted: it has been asked if these names, far from being the",Elementary Forms
41360,"mark of a very primitive religion, are not the slow product, either of",Elementary Forms
41360,"direct borrowings or of natural intercourse with others.[161] Also, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is no longer admitted that the roots once existed in an isolated state,Elementary Forms
41360,"as autonomous realities, nor that they allow us to reconstruct, even",Elementary Forms
41360,"hypothetically, the original language of the Indo-Europeans.[162]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, recent researches would tend to show that the Vedic divinities",Elementary Forms
41360,did not all have the exclusively naturistic character attributed to them,Elementary Forms
41360,by Max Mueller and his school.[163] But we shall leave aside those,Elementary Forms
41360,"questions, the discussion of which requires a special competence as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"philologist, and address ourselves directly to the general principles of",Elementary Forms
41360,the system. It will be important here not to confound the naturistic,Elementary Forms
41360,theory with these controverted postulates; for this is held by numbers,Elementary Forms
41360,of scholars who do not make language play the predominating role,Elementary Forms
41360,attributed to it by Max Mueller.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"That men have an interest in knowing the world which surrounds them, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently that their reflection should have been applied to it at an,Elementary Forms
41360,"early date, is something that everyone will readily admit. Co-operation",Elementary Forms
41360,with the things with which they were in immediate connection was so,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary for them that they could not fail to seek a knowledge of their,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. But if, as naturism pretends, it is of these reflections that",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious thought was born, it is impossible to explain how it was able",Elementary Forms
41360,"to survive the first attempts made, and the persistence with which it",Elementary Forms
41360,has maintained itself becomes unintelligible. If we have need of knowing,Elementary Forms
41360,"the nature of things, it is in order to act upon them in an appropriate",Elementary Forms
41360,"manner. But the conception of the universe given us by religion,",Elementary Forms
41360,"especially in its early forms, is too greatly mutilated to lead to",Elementary Forms
41360,temporarily useful practices. Things become nothing less than living and,Elementary Forms
41360,"thinking beings, minds or personalities like those which the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,imagination has made into the agents of cosmic phenomena. It is not by,Elementary Forms
41360,conceiving of them under this form or by treating them according to this,Elementary Forms
41360,conception that men could make them work for their ends. It is not by,Elementary Forms
41360,"addressing prayers to them, by celebrating them in feasts and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrifices, or by imposing upon themselves fasts and privations, that",Elementary Forms
41360,men can deter them from working harm or oblige them to serve their own,Elementary Forms
41360,"designs. Such processes could succeed only very exceptionally and, so to",Elementary Forms
41360,"speak, miraculously. If, then, religion's reason for existence was to",Elementary Forms
41360,give us a conception of the world which would guide us in our relations,Elementary Forms
41360,"with it, it was in no condition to fulfil its function, and people would",Elementary Forms
41360,"not have been slow to perceive it: failures, being infinitely more",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequent than successes, would have quickly shown them that they were",Elementary Forms
41360,"following a false route, and religion, shaken at each instant by these",Elementary Forms
41360,"repeated contradictions, would not have been able to survive.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is undeniably true that errors have been able to perpetuate,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves in history; but, except under a union of very exceptional",Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances, they can never perpetuate themselves thus unless they",Elementary Forms
41360,"were _true practically_, that is to say, unless, without giving us a",Elementary Forms
41360,"theoretically exact idea of the things with which they deal, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"express well enough the manner in which they affect us, either for good",Elementary Forms
41360,"or for bad. Under these circumstances, the actions which they determine",Elementary Forms
41360,"have every chance of being, at least in a general way, the very ones",Elementary Forms
41360,"which are proper, so it is easily explained how they have been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,survive the proofs of experience.[164] But an error and especially a,Elementary Forms
41360,"system of errors which leads to, and can lead to nothing but mistaken",Elementary Forms
41360,"and useless practices, has no chance of living. Now what is there in",Elementary Forms
41360,common between the rites with which the believer tries to act upon,Elementary Forms
41360,nature and the processes by which science has taught us to make use of,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, and which we now know are the only efficacious ones? If that is what",Elementary Forms
41360,"men demanded of religion, it is impossible to see how it could have",Elementary Forms
41360,"maintained itself, unless clever tricks had prevented their seeing that",Elementary Forms
41360,it did not give them what they expected from it. It would be necessary,Elementary Forms
41360,to return again to the over simple explanations of the eighteenth,Elementary Forms
41360,century.[165],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus it is only in appearance that naturism escapes the objection which,Elementary Forms
41360,we recently raised against animism. It also makes religion a system of,Elementary Forms
41360,"hallucinations, since it reduces it to an immense metaphor with no",Elementary Forms
41360,objective value. It is true that it gives religion a point of departure,Elementary Forms
41360,"in reality, to wit, in the sensations which the phenomena of nature",Elementary Forms
41360,"provoke in us; but by the bewitching action of language, this sensation",Elementary Forms
41360,is soon transformed into extravagant conceptions. Religious thought does,Elementary Forms
41360,"not come in contact with reality, except to cover it at once with a",Elementary Forms
41360,thick veil which conceals its real forms: this veil is the tissue of,Elementary Forms
41360,"fabulous beliefs which mythology brought forth. Thus the believer, like",Elementary Forms
41360,"the delirious man, lives in a world peopled with beings and things which",Elementary Forms
41360,"have only a verbal existence. Max Mueller himself recognized this, for he",Elementary Forms
41360,"regarded myths as the product of a disease of the intellect. At first,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he attributed them to a disease of language, but since language and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"intellect are inseparable for him, what is true of the one is true of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the other. ""When trying to explain the inmost nature of mythology,"" he",Elementary Forms
41360,"says, ""I called it a disease of Language rather than of Thought....",Elementary Forms
41360,After I had fully explained in my _Science of Thought_ that language and,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought are inseparable, and that a disease of language is therefore the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same thing as a disease of thought, no doubt ought to have remained as",Elementary Forms
41360,to what I meant. To represent the supreme God as committing every kind,Elementary Forms
41360,"of crime, as being deceived by men, as being angry with his wife and",Elementary Forms
41360,"violent with his children, is surely a proof of a disease, of an unusual",Elementary Forms
41360,"condition of thought, or, to speak more clearly, of real madness.""[166]",Elementary Forms
41360,"And this argument is not valid merely against Max Mueller and his theory,",Elementary Forms
41360,"but against the very principle of naturism, in whatever way it may be",Elementary Forms
41360,"applied. Whatever we may do, if religion has as its principal object the",Elementary Forms
41360,"expression of the forces of nature, it is impossible to see in it",Elementary Forms
41360,"anything more than a system of lying fictions, whose survival is",Elementary Forms
41360,incomprehensible.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Max Mueller thought he escaped this objection, whose gravity he felt, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguishing radically between mythology and religion, and by putting",Elementary Forms
41360,the first outside the second. He claims the right of reserving the name,Elementary Forms
41360,of religion for only those beliefs which conform to the prescriptions of,Elementary Forms
41360,a sane moral system and a rational theology. The myths were parasitic,Elementary Forms
41360,"growths which, under the influence of language, attached themselves upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"these fundamental conceptions, and denatured them. Thus the belief in",Elementary Forms
41360,Zeus was religious in so far as the Greeks considered him the supreme,Elementary Forms
41360,"God, father of humanity, protector of laws, avenger of crimes, etc.; but",Elementary Forms
41360,"all that which concerned the biography of Zeus, his marriages and his",Elementary Forms
41360,"adventures, was only mythology.[167]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this distinction is arbitrary. It is true that mythology has an,Elementary Forms
41360,aesthetic interest as well as one for the history of religions; but it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"one of the essential elements of the religious life, nevertheless. If",Elementary Forms
41360,"the myth were withdrawn from religion, it would be necessary to withdraw",Elementary Forms
41360,the rite also; for the rites are generally addressed to definite,Elementary Forms
41360,"personalities who have a name, a character, determined attributes and a",Elementary Forms
41360,"history, and they vary according to the manner in which these",Elementary Forms
41360,personalities are conceived. The cult rendered to a divinity depends,Elementary Forms
41360,upon the character attributed to him; and it is the myth which,Elementary Forms
41360,"determines this character. Very frequently, the rite is nothing more",Elementary Forms
41360,than the myth put in action; the Christian communion is inseparable from,Elementary Forms
41360,"the myth of the Last Supper, from which it derives all its meaning. Then",Elementary Forms
41360,"if all mythology is the result of a sort of verbal delirium, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"question which we raised remains intact: the existence, and especially",Elementary Forms
41360,the persistence of the cult become inexplicable. It is hard to,Elementary Forms
41360,understand how men have continued to do certain things for centuries,Elementary Forms
41360,"without any object. Moreover, it is not merely the peculiar traits of",Elementary Forms
41360,the divine personalities which are determined by mythology; the very,Elementary Forms
41360,idea that there are gods or spiritual beings set above the various,Elementary Forms
41360,"departments of nature, in no matter what manner they may be represented,",Elementary Forms
41360,is essentially mythical.[168] Now if all that which appertains to the,Elementary Forms
41360,notion of gods conceived as cosmic agents is blotted out of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions of the past, what remains? The idea of a divinity in itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,of a transcendental power upon which man depends and upon which he,Elementary Forms
41360,supports himself? But that is only an abstract and philosophic,Elementary Forms
41360,conception which has been fully realized in no historical religion; it,Elementary Forms
41360,is without interest for the science of religions.[169] We must therefore,Elementary Forms
41360,"avoid distinguishing between religious beliefs, keeping some because",Elementary Forms
41360,they seem to us to be true and sane and rejecting others because they,Elementary Forms
41360,"shock and disconcert us. All myths, even those which we find the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"unreasonable, have been believed.[170] Men have believed in them no less",Elementary Forms
41360,firmly than in their own sensations; they have based their conduct upon,Elementary Forms
41360,"them. In spite of appearances, it is therefore impossible that they",Elementary Forms
41360,should be without objective foundation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it will be said that in whatever manner religions may be",Elementary Forms
41360,"explained, it is certain that they are mistaken in regard to the real",Elementary Forms
41360,nature of things: science has proved it. The modes of action which they,Elementary Forms
41360,counsel or prescribe to men can therefore rarely have useful effects: it,Elementary Forms
41360,is not by lustrations that the sick are cured nor by sacrifices and,Elementary Forms
41360,chants that the crops are made to grow. Thus the objection which we have,Elementary Forms
41360,made to naturism would seem to be applicable to all possible systems of,Elementary Forms
41360,explanation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nevertheless, there is one which escapes it. Let us suppose that",Elementary Forms
41360,religion responds to quite another need than that of adapting ourselves,Elementary Forms
41360,to sensible objects: then it will not risk being weakened by the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it does not satisfy, or only badly satisfies, this need. If",Elementary Forms
41360,religious faith was not born to put man in harmony with the material,Elementary Forms
41360,"world, the injuries which it has been able to do him in his struggle",Elementary Forms
41360,"with the world do not touch it at its source, because it is fed from",Elementary Forms
41360,another.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If it is not for these reasons that a man comes to believe, he should",Elementary Forms
41360,continue to believe even when these reasons are contradicted by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"facts. It is even conceivable that faith should be strong enough, not",Elementary Forms
41360,"only to support these contradictions, but also even to deny them and to",Elementary Forms
41360,keep the believer from seeing their importance; this is what succeeds in,Elementary Forms
41360,rendering them inoffensive for religion. When the religious sentiment is,Elementary Forms
41360,"active, it will not admit that religion can be in the wrong, and it",Elementary Forms
41360,readily suggests explanations which make it appear innocent; if the rite,Elementary Forms
41360,"does not produce the desired results, this failure is imputed either to",Elementary Forms
41360,"some fault of execution, or to the intervention of another, contrary",Elementary Forms
41360,"deity. But for that, it is necessary that these religious ideas have",Elementary Forms
41360,their source in another sentiment than that betrayed by these deceptions,Elementary Forms
41360,"of experience, or else whence could come their force of resistance?",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But more than that, even if men had really had reasons for remaining",Elementary Forms
41360,"obstinate, in spite of all their mistakes, in expressing cosmic",Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena in religious terms, it is also necessary that these be of a",Elementary Forms
41360,nature to suggest such an interpretation. Now when could they have,Elementary Forms
41360,gotten such a property? Here again we find ourselves in the presence of,Elementary Forms
41360,one of those postulates which pass as evident only because they have not,Elementary Forms
41360,been criticized. It is stated as an axiom that in the natural play of,Elementary Forms
41360,physical forces there is all that is needed to arouse within us the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,of the sacred; but when we closely examine the proofs of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"proposition, which, by the way, are sufficiently brief, we find that",Elementary Forms
41360,they reduce to a prejudice.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,They talk about the marvel which men should feel as they discover the,Elementary Forms
41360,"world. But really, that which characterizes the life of nature is a",Elementary Forms
41360,regularity which approaches monotony. Every morning the sun mounts in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the horizon, every evening it sets; every month the moon goes through",Elementary Forms
41360,the same cycle; the river flows in an uninterrupted manner in its bed;,Elementary Forms
41360,the same seasons periodically bring back the same sensations. To be,Elementary Forms
41360,"sure, here and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is",Elementary Forms
41360,"eclipsed, the moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows. But",Elementary Forms
41360,these momentary variations could only give birth to equally momentary,Elementary Forms
41360,"impressions, the remembrance of which is gone after a little while; they",Elementary Forms
41360,could not serve as a basis for these stable and permanent systems of,Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas and practices which constitute religions. Normally, the course of",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature is uniform, and uniformity could never produce strong emotions.",Elementary Forms
41360,Representing the savage as filled with admiration before these marvels,Elementary Forms
41360,transports much more recent sentiments to the beginnings of history. He,Elementary Forms
41360,is much too accustomed to it to be greatly surprised by it. It requires,Elementary Forms
41360,culture and reflection to shake off this yoke of habit and to discover,Elementary Forms
41360,"how marvellous this regularity itself is. Besides, as we have already",Elementary Forms
41360,"remarked,[171] admiring an object is not enough to make it appear sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"to us, that is to say, to mark it with those characteristics which make",Elementary Forms
41360,all direct contact with it appear a sacrilege and a profanation. We,Elementary Forms
41360,"misunderstand what the religious sentiment really is, if we confound it",Elementary Forms
41360,with every impression of admiration and surprise.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But, they say, even if it is not admiration, there is a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,impression which men cannot help feeling in the presence of nature. He,Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot come in contact with it, without realizing that it is greater",Elementary Forms
41360,than he. It overwhelms him by its immensity. This sensation of an,Elementary Forms
41360,"infinite space which surrounds him, of an infinite time which has",Elementary Forms
41360,"preceded and will follow the present moment, and of forces infinitely",Elementary Forms
41360,"superior to those of which he is master, cannot fail, as it seems, to",Elementary Forms
41360,awaken within him the idea that outside of him there exists an infinite,Elementary Forms
41360,power upon which he depends. And this idea enters as an essential,Elementary Forms
41360,element into our conception of the divine.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But let us bear in mind what the question is. We are trying to find out,Elementary Forms
41360,how men came to think that there are in reality two categories of,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, radically heterogeneous and incomparable to each other. Now how",Elementary Forms
41360,could the spectacle of nature give rise to the idea of this duality?,Elementary Forms
41360,Nature is always and everywhere of the same sort. It matters little that,Elementary Forms
41360,it extends to infinity: beyond the extreme limit to which my eyes can,Elementary Forms
41360,"reach, it is not different from what it is here. The space which I",Elementary Forms
41360,"imagine beyond the horizon is still space, identical with that which I",Elementary Forms
41360,see. The time which flows without end is made up of moments identical,Elementary Forms
41360,"with those which I have passed through. Extension, like duration,",Elementary Forms
41360,repeats itself indefinitely; if the portions which I touch have of,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves no sacred character, where did the others get theirs? The",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact that I do not see them directly, is not enough to transform",Elementary Forms
41360,them.[172] A world of profane things may well be unlimited; but it,Elementary Forms
41360,remains a profane world. Do they say that the physical forces with which,Elementary Forms
41360,we come in contact exceed our own? Sacred forces are not to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguished from profane ones simply by their greater intensity, they",Elementary Forms
41360,are different; they have special qualities which the others do not have.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Quite on the contrary, all the forces manifested in the universe are of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same nature, those that are within us just as those that are outside",Elementary Forms
41360,"of us. And especially, there is no reason which could have allowed",Elementary Forms
41360,giving a sort of pre-eminent dignity to some in relation to others. Then,Elementary Forms
41360,if religion really was born because of the need of assigning causes to,Elementary Forms
41360,"physical phenomena, the forces thus imagined would have been no more",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred than those conceived by the scientist to-day to account for the,Elementary Forms
41360,same facts.[173] This is as much as to say that there would have been,Elementary Forms
41360,no sacred beings and therefore no religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But even supposing that this sensation of being ""overwhelmed"" were",Elementary Forms
41360,"really able to suggest religious ideas, it could not have produced this",Elementary Forms
41360,"effect upon the primitive, for he does not have it. He is in no way",Elementary Forms
41360,conscious that cosmic forces are so superior to his own. Since science,Elementary Forms
41360,"has not yet taught him modesty, he attributes to himself an empire over",Elementary Forms
41360,"things which he really does not have, but the illusion of which is",Elementary Forms
41360,enough to prevent his feeling dominated by them. As we have already,Elementary Forms
41360,"pointed out, he thinks that he can command the elements, release the",Elementary Forms
41360,"winds, compel the rain to fall, or stop the sun, by a gesture, etc.[174]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Religion itself contributes to giving him this security, for he believes",Elementary Forms
41360,"that it arms him with extended powers over nature. His rites are, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"part, means destined to aid him in imposing his will upon the world.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus, far from being due to the sentiment which men should have of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"littleness before the universe, religions are rather inspired by the",Elementary Forms
41360,contrary sentiment. Even the most elevated and idealistic have the,Elementary Forms
41360,effect of reassuring men in their struggle with things: they teach that,Elementary Forms
41360,"faith is, of itself, able ""to move mountains,"" that is to say, to",Elementary Forms

41360,"Howsoever opposed their conclusions may seem to be, the two systems",Elementary Forms
41360,which we have just studied agree upon one essential point: they state,Elementary Forms
41360,the problem in identical terms. Both undertake to construct the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,the divine out of the sensations aroused in us by certain natural,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena, either physical or biological. For the animists it is dreams,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the naturists, certain cosmic phenomena, which served as the point",Elementary Forms
41360,"of departure for religious evolution. But for both, it is in the nature,",Elementary Forms
41360,"either of man or of the universe, that we must look for the germ of the",Elementary Forms
41360,grand opposition which separates the profane from the sacred.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But such an enterprise is impossible: it supposes a veritable creation,Elementary Forms
41360,_ex nihilo_. A fact of common experience cannot give us the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,something whose characteristic is to be outside the world of common,Elementary Forms
41360,"experience. A man, as he appears to himself in his dreams, is only a",Elementary Forms
41360,"man. Natural forces, as our senses perceive them, are only natural",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces, howsoever great their intensity may be. Hence comes the common",Elementary Forms
41360,criticism which we address to both doctrines. In order to explain how,Elementary Forms
41360,these pretended data of religious thought have been able to take a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character which has no objective foundation, it would be",Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to admit that a whole world of delusive representations has,Elementary Forms
41360,"superimposed itself upon the other, denatured it to the point of making",Elementary Forms
41360,"it unrecognizable, and substituted a pure hallucination for reality.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Here, it is the illusions of the dream which brought about this",Elementary Forms
41360,"transfiguration; there, it is the brilliant and vain company of images",Elementary Forms
41360,"evoked by the word. But in one case as in the other, it is necessary to",Elementary Forms
41360,regard religion as the product of a delirious imagination.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus one positive conclusion is arrived at as the result of this,Elementary Forms
41360,critical examination. Since neither man nor nature have of themselves a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character, they must get it from another source. Aside from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"human individual and the physical world, there should be some other",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality, in relation to which this variety of delirium which all",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is in a sense, has a significance and an objective value. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"other words, beyond those which we have called animistic and naturistic,",Elementary Forms
41360,"there should be another sort of cult, more fundamental and more",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive, of which the first are only derived forms or particular",Elementary Forms
41360,aspects.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, this cult does exist: it is the one to which ethnologists have",Elementary Forms
41360,given the name of totemism.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It was only at the end of the eighteenth century that the word totem,Elementary Forms
41360,appeared in ethnographical literature. It is found for the first time in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the book of an Indian interpreter, J. Long, which was published in",Elementary Forms
41360,"London in 1791.[175] For nearly a half a century, totemism was known",Elementary Forms
41360,only as something exclusively American.[176] It was only in 1841 that,Elementary Forms
41360,"Grey, in a passage which has remained celebrated,[177] pointed out the",Elementary Forms
41360,"existence of wholly similar practices in Australia. From that time on,",Elementary Forms
41360,scholars began to realize that they were in the presence of a system of,Elementary Forms
41360,a certain generality.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But they saw there only an essentially archaic institution, an",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnographical curiosity, having no great interest for the historian.",Elementary Forms
41360,MacLennan was the first who undertook to attach totemism to the general,Elementary Forms
41360,history of humanity. In a series of articles in the _Fortnightly,Elementary Forms
41360,"Review_,[178] he set himself to show that totemism was not only a",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, but one from which were derived a multitude of beliefs and",Elementary Forms
41360,practices which are found in much more advanced religious systems. He,Elementary Forms
41360,even went so far as to make it the source of all the animal-worshipping,Elementary Forms
41360,and plant-worshipping cults which are found among ancient peoples.,Elementary Forms
41360,Certainly this extension of totemism was abusive. The cults of animals,Elementary Forms
41360,"and plants depend upon numerous causes which cannot be reduced to one,",Elementary Forms
41360,"without the error of too great simplicity. But this error, by its very",Elementary Forms
41360,"exaggerations, had at least the advantage, that it put into evidence the",Elementary Forms
41360,historical importance of totemism.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Students of American totemism had already known for a long time that,Elementary Forms
41360,this form of religion was most intimately united to a determined social,Elementary Forms
41360,"organization, that its basis is the division of the social group into",Elementary Forms
41360,"clans.[179] In 1877, in his _Ancient Society_,[180] Lewis H. Morgan",Elementary Forms
41360,"undertook to make a study of it, to determine its distinctive",Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristics, and at the same time to point out its generality among",Elementary Forms
41360,the Indian tribes of North and Central America. At nearly the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"moment, and even following the direct suggestion of Morgan, Fison and",Elementary Forms
41360,Howitt[181] established the existence of the same social system in,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia, as well as its relations with totemism.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Under the influence of these directing ideas, observations could be made",Elementary Forms
41360,with better method. The researches which the American Bureau of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Ethnology undertook, played an important part in the advance of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"studies.[182] By 1887, the documents were sufficiently numerous and",Elementary Forms
41360,significant to make Frazer consider it time to unite them and present,Elementary Forms
41360,them to us in a systematic form. Such is the object of his little book,Elementary Forms
41360,"_Totemism_,[183] where the system is studied both as a religion and as a",Elementary Forms
41360,legal institution. But this study was purely descriptive; no effort was,Elementary Forms
41360,made to explain totemism[184] or to understand its fundamental notions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Robertson Smith is the first who undertook this work of elaboration. He,Elementary Forms
41360,realized more clearly than any of his predecessors how rich this crude,Elementary Forms
41360,and confused religion is in germs for the future. It is true that,Elementary Forms
41360,MacLennan had already connected it with the great religions of,Elementary Forms
41360,antiquity; but that was merely because he thought he had found here and,Elementary Forms
41360,there the cult of animals or plants. Now if we reduce totemism to a sort,Elementary Forms
41360,"of animal or plant worship, we have seen only its most superficial",Elementary Forms
41360,aspect: we have even misunderstood its real nature. Going beyond the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mere letter of the totemic beliefs, Smith set himself to find the",Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental principles upon which they depend. In his book upon _Kinship,Elementary Forms
41360,"and Marriage in Early Arabia_,[185] he had already pointed out that",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism supposes a likeness in nature, either natural or acquired, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"men and animals (or plants). In his _The Religion of the Semites_,[186]",Elementary Forms
41360,he makes this same idea the first origin of the entire sacrificial,Elementary Forms
41360,system: it is to totemism that humanity owes the principle of the,Elementary Forms
41360,communion meal. It is true that the theory of Smith can now be shown,Elementary Forms
41360,one-sided; it is no longer adequate for the facts actually known; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"for all that, it contains an ingenious theory and has exercised a most",Elementary Forms
41360,fertile influence upon the science of religions. The _Golden Bough_[187],Elementary Forms
41360,"of Frazer is inspired by these same ideas, for totemism, which MacLennan",Elementary Forms
41360,"had attached to the religions of classical antiquity, and Smith to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"religions of the Semitic peoples, is here connected to the European",Elementary Forms
41360,folk-lore. The schools of MacLennan and Morgan are thus united to that,Elementary Forms
41360,of Mannhardt.[188],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"During this time, the American tradition continued to develop with an",Elementary Forms
41360,independence which it has kept up until very recent times. Three groups,Elementary Forms
41360,of societies were the special object of the researches which were,Elementary Forms
41360,"concerned with totemism. These are, first, certain tribes of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"North-west, the Tlinkit, the Haida, the Kwakiutl, the Salish and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Tsimshian; then, the great nation of the Sioux; and finally, the Pueblo",Elementary Forms
41360,Indians in the south-western part of the United States. The first were,Elementary Forms
41360,"studied principally by Dall, Krause, Boas, Swanton, Hill Tout; the",Elementary Forms
41360,"second by Dorsey; the last by Mindeleff, Mrs. Stevenson and",Elementary Forms
41360,Cushing.[189] But however rich the harvest of facts thus gathered in all,Elementary Forms
41360,"parts of the country may have been, the documents at our disposal were",Elementary Forms
41360,still fragmentary. Though the American religions contain numerous traces,Elementary Forms
41360,"of totemism, they have passed the stage of real totemism. On the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, observations in Australia had brought little more than scattered",Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs and isolated rites, initiation rituals and interdictions",Elementary Forms
41360,relative to totemism. It was with facts taken from all these sources,Elementary Forms
41360,that Frazer attempted to draw a picture of totemism in its entirety.,Elementary Forms
41360,Whatever may be the incontestable merit of the reconstruction undertaken,Elementary Forms
41360,"in such circumstances, it could not help being incomplete and",Elementary Forms
41360,hypothetical. A totemic religion in complete action had not yet been,Elementary Forms
41360,observed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is only in very recent years that this serious deficiency has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"repaired. Two observers of remarkable ability, Baldwin Spencer and F. J.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Gillen, discovered[190] in the interior of the Australian continent a",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable number of tribes whose basis and unity was founded in,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic beliefs. The results of their observations have been published,Elementary Forms
41360,"in two works, which have given a new life to the study of totemism. The",Elementary Forms
41360,"first of these, _The Native Tribes of Central Australia_,[191] deals",Elementary Forms
41360,"with the more central of these tribes, the Arunta, the Luritcha, and a",Elementary Forms
41360,"little farther to the south, on the shores of Lake Eyre, the Urabunna.",Elementary Forms
41360,"The second, which is entitled _The Northern Tribes of Central",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia_,[192] deals with the societies north of the Urabunna,",Elementary Forms
41360,occupying the territory between MacDonnell's Range and Carpenter Gulf.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the principal of these we may mention the Unmatjera, the Kaitish,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Warramunga, the Worgaia, the Tjingilli, the Binbinga, the Walpari,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Gnanji and finally, on the very shores of the gulf, the Mara and the",Elementary Forms
41360,Anula.[193],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"More recently, a German missionary, Carl Strehlow, who has also passed",Elementary Forms
41360,"long years in these same Central Australian societies,[194] has",Elementary Forms
41360,"commenced to publish his own observations on two of these tribes, the",Elementary Forms
41360,Aranda and the Loritja (the Arunta and Luritcha of Spencer and,Elementary Forms
41360,Gillen).[195] Having well mastered the language spoken by these,Elementary Forms
41360,"peoples,[196] Strehlow has been able to bring us a large number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic myths and religious songs, which are given us, for the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"part, in the original text. In spite of some differences of detail which",Elementary Forms
41360,are easily explained and whose importance has been greatly,Elementary Forms
41360,"exaggerated,[197] we shall see that the observations of Strehlow, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"completing, making more precise and sometimes even rectifying those of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen, confirm them in all that is essential.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These discoveries have given rise to an abundant literature to which we,Elementary Forms
41360,shall have occasion to return. The works of Spencer and Gillen,Elementary Forms
41360,"especially have exercised a considerable influence, not only because",Elementary Forms
41360,"they were the oldest, but also because the facts were there presented in",Elementary Forms
41360,"a systematic form, which was of a nature to give a direction to later",Elementary Forms
41360,"studies,[198] and to stimulate speculation. Their results were commented",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon, discussed and interpreted in all possible manners. At this same",Elementary Forms
41360,"time, Howitt, whose fragmentary studies were scattered in a number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"different publications,[199] undertook to do for the southern tribes",Elementary Forms
41360,what Spencer and Gillen had done for those of the centre. In his _Native,Elementary Forms
41360,"Tribes of South-East Australia_,[200] he gives us a view of the social",Elementary Forms
41360,"organization of the peoples who occupy Southern Australia, New South",Elementary Forms
41360,"Wales, and a good part of Queensland. The progress thus realized",Elementary Forms
41360,suggested to Frazer the idea of completing his Totemism by a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,compendium[201] where would be brought together all the important,Elementary Forms
41360,documents which are concerned either with the totemic religion or the,Elementary Forms
41360,"family and matrimonial organization which, rightly or wrongly, is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to be connected with this religion. The purpose of this book is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not to give us a general and systematic view of totemism, but rather to",Elementary Forms
41360,put the materials necessary for a construction of this sort at the,Elementary Forms
41360,disposition of scholars.[202] The facts are here arranged in a strictly,Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnographical and geographical order: each continent, and within the",Elementary Forms
41360,"continent, each tribe or ethnic group is studied separately. Though so",Elementary Forms
41360,"extended a study, where so many diverse peoples are successively passed",Elementary Forms
41360,"in review, could hardly be equally thorough in all its parts, still it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a useful hand-book to consult, and one which can aid greatly in",Elementary Forms
41360,facilitating researches.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,From this historical resume it is clear that Australia is the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"favourable field for the study of totemism, and therefore we shall make",Elementary Forms
41360,it the principal area of our observations.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In his _Totemism_, Frazer sought especially to collect all the traces of",Elementary Forms
41360,totemism which could be found in history or ethnography. He was thus led,Elementary Forms
41360,to include in his study societies the nature and degree of whose culture,Elementary Forms
41360,"differs most widely: ancient Egypt,[203] Arabia and Greece,[204] and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"southern Slavs[205] are found there, side by side with the tribes of",Elementary Forms
41360,Australia and America. This manner of procedure is not at all surprising,Elementary Forms
41360,for a disciple of the anthropological school. For this school does not,Elementary Forms
41360,seek to locate religions in the social environments of which they are a,Elementary Forms
41360,"part,[206] and to differentiate them according to the different",Elementary Forms
41360,"environments to which they are thus connected. But rather, as is",Elementary Forms
41360,"indicated by the name which it has taken to itself, its purpose is to go",Elementary Forms
41360,beyond the national and historical differences to the universal and,Elementary Forms
41360,really human bases of the religious life. It is supposed that man has a,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious nature of himself, in virtue of his own constitution, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"independently of all social conditions, and they propose to study",Elementary Forms
41360,"this.[207] For researches of this sort, all peoples can be called upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"equally well. It is true that they prefer the more primitive peoples,",Elementary Forms
41360,because this fundamental nature is more apt to be unaltered here; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"since it is found equally well among the most civilized peoples, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"but natural that they too should be called as witnesses. Consequently,",Elementary Forms
41360,"all those who pass as being not too far removed from the origins, and",Elementary Forms
41360,who are confusedly lumped together under the rather imprecise rubric of,Elementary Forms
41360,"_savages_, are put on the same plane and consulted indifferently. Since",Elementary Forms
41360,"from this point of view, facts have an interest only in proportion to",Elementary Forms
41360,"their generality, they consider themselves obliged to collect as large a",Elementary Forms
41360,number as possible of them; the circle of comparisons could not become,Elementary Forms
41360,too large.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Our method will not be such a one, for several reasons.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, for the sociologist as for the historian, social",Elementary Forms
41360,facts vary with the social system of which they form a part; they cannot,Elementary Forms
41360,be understood when detached from it. This is why two facts which come,Elementary Forms
41360,from two different societies cannot be profitably compared merely,Elementary Forms
41360,because they seem to resemble each other; it is necessary that these,Elementary Forms
41360,"societies themselves resemble each other, that is to say, that they be",Elementary Forms
41360,only varieties of the same species. The comparative method would be,Elementary Forms
41360,"impossible, if social types did not exist, and it cannot be usefully",Elementary Forms
41360,applied except within a single type. What errors have not been committed,Elementary Forms
41360,for having neglected this precept! It is thus that facts have been,Elementary Forms
41360,"unduly connected with each other which, in spite of exterior",Elementary Forms
41360,"resemblances, really have neither the same sense nor the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"importance: the primitive democracy and that of to-day, the collectivism",Elementary Forms
41360,"of inferior societies and actual socialistic tendencies, the monogamy",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is frequent in Australian tribes and that sanctioned by our laws,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc. Even in the work of Frazer such confusions are found. It frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,happens that he assimilates simple rites of wild-animal-worship to,Elementary Forms
41360,"practices that are really totemic, though the distance, sometimes very",Elementary Forms
41360,"great, which separates the two social systems would exclude all idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,"assimilation. Then if we do not wish to fall into these same errors,",Elementary Forms
41360,"instead of scattering our researches over all the societies possible, we",Elementary Forms
41360,must concentrate them upon one clearly determined type.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is even necessary that this concentration be as close as possible.,Elementary Forms
41360,One cannot usefully compare facts with which he is not perfectly well,Elementary Forms
41360,acquainted. But when he undertakes to include all sorts of societies and,Elementary Forms
41360,"civilizations, one cannot know any of them with the necessary",Elementary Forms
41360,thoroughness; when he assembles facts from every country in order to,Elementary Forms
41360,"compare them, he is obliged to take them hastily, without having either",Elementary Forms
41360,the means or the time to carefully criticize them. Tumultuous and,Elementary Forms
41360,"summary comparisons result, which discredit the comparative method with",Elementary Forms
41360,many intelligent persons. It can give serious results only when it is,Elementary Forms
41360,applied to so limited a number of societies that each of them can be,Elementary Forms
41360,studied with sufficient precision. The essential thing is to choose,Elementary Forms
41360,those where investigations have the greatest chance to be fruitful.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, the value of the facts is much more important than their number.",Elementary Forms
41360,"In our eyes, the question whether totemism has been more or less",Elementary Forms
41360,"universal or not, is quite secondary.[208] If it interests us, it does",Elementary Forms
41360,so before all because in studying it we hope to discover relations of a,Elementary Forms
41360,nature to make us understand better what religion is. Now to establish,Elementary Forms
41360,these relations it is neither necessary nor always useful to heap up,Elementary Forms
41360,numerous experiences upon each other; it is much more important to have,Elementary Forms
41360,a few that are well studied and really significant. One single fact may,Elementary Forms
41360,"make a law appear, where a multitude of imprecise and vague observations",Elementary Forms
41360,"would only produce confusion. In every science, the scholar would be",Elementary Forms
41360,"overwhelmed by the facts which present themselves to him, if he did not",Elementary Forms
41360,make a choice among them. It is necessary that he distinguish those,Elementary Forms
41360,"which promise to be the most instructive, that he concentrate his",Elementary Forms
41360,"attention upon these, and that he temporarily leave the others to one",Elementary Forms
41360,side.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"That is why, with one reservation which will be indicated below, we",Elementary Forms
41360,propose to limit our research to Australian societies. They fulfil all,Elementary Forms
41360,the conditions which were just enumerated. They are perfectly,Elementary Forms
41360,"homogeneous, for though it is possible to distinguish varieties among",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, they all belong to one common type. This homogeneity is even so",Elementary Forms
41360,"great that the forms of social organization are not only the same, but",Elementary Forms
41360,that they are even designated by identical or equivalent names in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"multitude of tribes, sometimes very distant from each other.[209] Also,",Elementary Forms
41360,Australian totemism is the variety for which our documents are the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"complete. Finally, that which we propose to study in this work is the",Elementary Forms
41360,most primitive and simple religion which it is possible to find. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"therefore natural that to discover it, we address ourselves to",Elementary Forms
41360,"societies as slightly evolved as possible, for it is evidently there",Elementary Forms
41360,that we have the greatest chance of finding it and studying it well. Now,Elementary Forms
41360,there are no societies which present this characteristic to a higher,Elementary Forms
41360,degree than the Australian ones. Not only is their civilization most,Elementary Forms
41360,rudimentary--the house and even the hut are still unknown--but also,Elementary Forms
41360,their organization is the most primitive and simple which is actually,Elementary Forms
41360,known; it is that which we have elsewhere called _organization on a,Elementary Forms
41360,"basis of clans_.[210] In the next chapter, we shall have occasion to",Elementary Forms
41360,restate its essential traits.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, though making Australia the principal field of our research, we",Elementary Forms
41360,think it best not to leave completely aside the societies where totemism,Elementary Forms
41360,"was first discovered, that is to say, the Indian tribes of North",Elementary Forms
41360,America.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This extension of the field of comparison has nothing about it which is,Elementary Forms
41360,not legitimate. Undoubtedly these people are more advanced than those of,Elementary Forms
41360,Australia. Their civilization has become much more advanced: men there,Elementary Forms
41360,"live in houses or under tents, and there are even fortified villages.",Elementary Forms
41360,"The size of the society is much greater, and centralization, which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"completely lacking in Australia, is beginning to appear there; we find",Elementary Forms
41360,"vast confederations, such as that of the Iroquois, under one central",Elementary Forms
41360,authority. Sometimes a complicated system of differentiated classes,Elementary Forms
41360,"arranged in a hierarchy is found. However, the essential lines of the",Elementary Forms
41360,social structure remain the same as those in Australia; it is always the,Elementary Forms
41360,organization on a basis of clans. Thus we are not in the presence of two,Elementary Forms
41360,"different types, but of two varieties of a single type, which are still",Elementary Forms
41360,very close to each other. They represent two successive moments of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"single evolution, so their homogeneousness is still great enough to",Elementary Forms
41360,permit comparisons.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, these comparisons may have their utility. Just because their",Elementary Forms
41360,"civilization is more advanced than that of the Australians, certain",Elementary Forms
41360,phases of the social organization which is common to both can be studied,Elementary Forms
41360,more easily among the first than among the second. As long as men are,Elementary Forms
41360,"still making their first steps in the art of expressing their thought,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is not easy for the observer to perceive that which moves them; for,Elementary Forms
41360,there is nothing to translate clearly that which passes in these obscure,Elementary Forms
41360,minds which have only a confused and ephemeral knowledge of themselves.,Elementary Forms
41360,"For example, religious symbols then consist only in formless",Elementary Forms
41360,"combinations of lines and colours, whose sense it is not easy to divine,",Elementary Forms
41360,as we shall see. There are many gestures and movements by which interior,Elementary Forms
41360,"states express themselves; but being essentially ephemeral, they",Elementary Forms
41360,readily elude observation. That is why totemism was discovered earlier,Elementary Forms
41360,"in America than in Australia; it was much more visible there, though it",Elementary Forms
41360,"held relatively less place in the totality of the religious life. Also,",Elementary Forms
41360,wherever beliefs and institutions do not take a somewhat definite,Elementary Forms
41360,"material form, they are more liable to change under the influence of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"slightest circumstances, or to become wholly effaced from the memory.",Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the Australian clans frequently have something floating and Protean,Elementary Forms
41360,"about them, while the corresponding organization in America has a",Elementary Forms
41360,"greater stability and more clearly defined contours. Thus, though",Elementary Forms
41360,American totemism is further removed from its origins than that of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia, still there are important characteristics of which it has",Elementary Forms
41360,better kept the memory.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the second place, in order to understand an institution, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,frequently well to follow it into the advanced stages of its,Elementary Forms
41360,evolution;[211] for sometimes it is only when it is fully developed that,Elementary Forms
41360,its real signification appears with the greatest clearness. In this way,Elementary Forms
41360,"also, American totemism, since it has a long history behind it, could",Elementary Forms
41360,serve to clarify certain aspects of Australian totemism.[212] At the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, it will put us in a better condition to see how totemism is",Elementary Forms
41360,"bound up with the forms which follow, and to mark its place in the",Elementary Forms
41360,general historical development of religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So in the discussions which follow, we shall not forbid ourselves the",Elementary Forms
41360,use of certain facts borrowed from the Indian societies of North,Elementary Forms
41360,America. But we are not going to study American totemism here;[213] such,Elementary Forms
41360,"a study must be made directly and by itself, and cannot be mixed with",Elementary Forms
41360,the one which we are undertaking; it raises other problems and implies a,Elementary Forms
41360,wholly different set of special investigations. We shall have recourse,Elementary Forms
41360,"to American facts merely in a supplementary way, and only when they seem",Elementary Forms
41360,to be able to make us understand Australian facts to advantage. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,these latter which constitute the real and immediate object of our,Elementary Forms

41360,"Owing to its nature, our study will include two parts. Since every",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is made up of intellectual conceptions and ritual practices, we",Elementary Forms
41360,must deal successively with the beliefs and rites which compose the,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic religion. These two elements of the religious life are too,Elementary Forms
41360,closely connected with each other to allow of any radical separation. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle, the cult is derived from the beliefs, yet it reacts upon",Elementary Forms
41360,them; the myth is frequently modelled after the rite in order to account,Elementary Forms
41360,"for it, especially when its sense is no longer apparent. On the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, there are beliefs which are clearly manifested only through the",Elementary Forms
41360,rites which express them. So these two parts of our analysis cannot fail,Elementary Forms
41360,"to overlap. However, these two orders of facts are so different that it",Elementary Forms
41360,is indispensable to study them separately. And since it is impossible to,Elementary Forms
41360,understand anything about a religion while unacquainted with the ideas,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which it rests, we must seek to become acquainted with these latter",Elementary Forms
41360,first of all.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is not our intention to retrace all the speculations into which,Elementary Forms
41360,"the religious thought, even of the Australians alone, has run. The",Elementary Forms
41360,things we wish to reach are the elementary notions at the basis of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, but there is no need of following them through all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"development, sometimes very confused, which the mythological imagination",Elementary Forms
41360,of these peoples has given them. We shall make use of myths when they,Elementary Forms
41360,"enable us to understand these fundamental ideas better, but we shall not",Elementary Forms
41360,make mythology itself the subject of our studies. In so far as this is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"work of art, it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the simple",Elementary Forms
41360,"science of religions. Also, the intellectual evolution from which it",Elementary Forms
41360,results is of too great a complexity to be studied indirectly and from a,Elementary Forms
41360,foreign point of view. It constitutes a very difficult problem which,Elementary Forms
41360,"must be treated by itself, for itself and with a method peculiar to",Elementary Forms
41360,itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the beliefs upon which totemism rests, the most important are",Elementary Forms
41360,naturally those concerning the totem; it is with these that we must,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,At the basis of nearly all the Australian tribes we find a group which,Elementary Forms
41360,holds a preponderating place in the collective life: this is the clan.,Elementary Forms
41360,Two essential traits characterize it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, the individuals who compose it consider themselves",Elementary Forms
41360,"united by a bond of kinship, but one which is of a very special nature.",Elementary Forms
41360,This relationship does not come from the fact that they have definite,Elementary Forms
41360,blood connections with one another; they are relatives from the mere,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact that they have the same name. They are not fathers and mothers,",Elementary Forms
41360,"sons or daughters, uncles or nephews of one another in the sense which",Elementary Forms
41360,we now give these words; yet they think of themselves as forming a,Elementary Forms
41360,"single family, which is large or small according to the dimensions of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the clan, merely because they are collectively designated by the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"word. When we say that they regard themselves as a single family, we do",Elementary Forms
41360,so because they recognize duties towards each other which are identical,Elementary Forms
41360,with those which have always been incumbent upon kindred: such duties as,Elementary Forms
41360,"aid, vengeance, mourning, the obligation not to marry among themselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By this first characteristic, the clan does not differ from the Roman",Elementary Forms
41360,_gens_ or the Greek [Greek: genos]; for this relationship also came,Elementary Forms
41360,merely from the fact that all the members of the _gens_ had the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"name,[215] the _nomen gentilicium_. And in one sense, the _gens_ is a",Elementary Forms
41360,clan; but it is a variety which should not be confounded with the,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian clan.[216] This latter is distinguished by the fact that its,Elementary Forms
41360,name is also the name of a determined species of material things with,Elementary Forms
41360,"which it believes that it has very particular relations, the nature of",Elementary Forms
41360,which we shall presently describe; they are especially relations of,Elementary Forms
41360,kinship. The species of things which serves to designate the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,collectively is called its _totem_. The totem of the clan is also that,Elementary Forms
41360,of each of its members.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Each clan has its totem, which belongs to it alone; two different clans",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the same tribe cannot have the same. In fact, one is a member of a",Elementary Forms
41360,clan merely because he has a certain name. All who bear this name are,Elementary Forms
41360,members of it for that very reason; in whatever manner they may be,Elementary Forms
41360,"spread over the tribal territory, they all have the same relations of",Elementary Forms
41360,"kinship with one another.[217] Consequently, two groups having the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem can only be two sections of the same clan. Undoubtedly, it",Elementary Forms
41360,frequently happens that all of a clan does not reside in the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"locality, but has representatives in several different places. However,",Elementary Forms
41360,this lack of a geographical basis does not cause its unity to be the,Elementary Forms
41360,less keenly felt.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In regard to the word totem, we may say that it is the one employed by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Ojibway, an Algonquin tribe, to designate the sort of thing whose",Elementary Forms
41360,name the clan bears.[218] Although this expression is not at all,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian,[219] and is found only in one single society in America,",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnographers have definitely adopted it, and use it to denote, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"general way, the system which we are describing. Schoolcraft was the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first to extend the meaning of the word thus and to speak of a ""totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"system.""[220] This extension, of which there are examples enough in",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnography, is not without inconveniences. It is not normal for an",Elementary Forms
41360,"institution of this importance to bear a chance name, taken from a",Elementary Forms
41360,"strictly local dialect, and bringing to mind none of the distinctive",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics of the thing it designates. But to-day this way of,Elementary Forms
41360,employing the word is so universally accepted that it would be an excess,Elementary Forms
41360,of purism to rise against this usage.[221],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a very large proportion of the cases, the objects which serve as",Elementary Forms
41360,"totems belong either to the animal or the vegetable kingdom, but",Elementary Forms
41360,especially to the former. Inanimate things are much more rarely,Elementary Forms
41360,employed. Out of more than 500 totemic names collected by Howitt among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the tribes of south-eastern Australia, there are scarcely forty which",Elementary Forms
41360,"are not the names of plants or animals; these are the clouds, rain,",Elementary Forms
41360,"hail, frost, the moon, the sun, the wind, the autumn, the summer, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"winter, certain stars, thunder, fire, smoke, water or the sea. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,"noticeable how small a place is given to celestial bodies and, more",Elementary Forms
41360,"generally, to the great cosmic phenomena, which were destined to so",Elementary Forms
41360,great a fortune in later religious development. Among all the clans of,Elementary Forms
41360,"which Howitt speaks, there were only two which had the moon as",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem,[222] two the sun,[223] three a star,[224] three the thunder,[225]",Elementary Forms
41360,"two the lightning.[226] The rain is a single exception; it, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, is very frequent.[227]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These are the totems which can be spoken of as normal. But totemism has,Elementary Forms
41360,its abnormalities as well. It sometimes happens that the totem is not a,Elementary Forms
41360,"whole object, but the part of an object. This fact appears rather rarely",Elementary Forms
41360,"in Australia;[228] Howitt cites only one example.[229] However, it may",Elementary Forms
41360,well be that this is found with a certain frequency in the tribes where,Elementary Forms
41360,the totemic groups are excessively subdivided; it might be said that the,Elementary Forms
41360,totems had to break themselves up in order to be able to furnish names,Elementary Forms
41360,to these numerous divisions. This is what seems to have taken place,Elementary Forms
41360,among the Arunta and the Loritja. Strehlow has collected 442 totems in,Elementary Forms
41360,"these two societies, of which many are not an animal species, but some",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular organ of the animal of the species, such as the tail or",Elementary Forms
41360,"stomach of an opossum, the fat of the kangaroo, etc.[230]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We have seen that normally the totem is not an individual, but a species",Elementary Forms
41360,"or a variety: it is not such and such a kangaroo or crow, but the",Elementary Forms
41360,"kangaroo or crow in general. Sometimes, however, it is a particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"object. First of all, this is necessarily the case when the thing",Elementary Forms
41360,"serving as totem is unique in its class, as the sun, the moon, such or",Elementary Forms
41360,"such a constellation, etc. It also happens that clans take their names",Elementary Forms
41360,"from certain geographical irregularities or depressions of the land,",Elementary Forms
41360,"from a certain ant-hill, etc. It is true that we have only a small",Elementary Forms
41360,number of examples of this in Australia; but Strehlow does mention,Elementary Forms
41360,some.[231] But the very causes which have given rise to these abnormal,Elementary Forms
41360,"totems show that they are of a relatively recent origin. In fact, what",Elementary Forms
41360,has made certain geographical features of the land become totems is that,Elementary Forms
41360,a mythical ancestor is supposed to have stopped there or to have,Elementary Forms
41360,performed some act of his legendary life there.[232] But at the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, these ancestors are represented in the myths as themselves",Elementary Forms
41360,"belonging to clans which had perfectly regular totems, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,"ones taken from the animal or vegetable kingdoms. Therefore, the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,names thus commemorating the acts and performances of these heroes,Elementary Forms
41360,cannot be primitive; they belong to a form of totemism that is already,Elementary Forms
41360,derived and deviated. It is even permissible to ask if the,Elementary Forms
41360,"meteorological totems have not a similar origin; for the sun, the moon",Elementary Forms
41360,and the stars are frequently identified with the ancestors of the,Elementary Forms
41360,mythological epoch.[233],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Sometimes, but no less exceptionally, it is an ancestor or a group of",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestors which serves as totem directly. In this case, the clan takes",Elementary Forms
41360,"its name, not from a thing or a species of real things, but from a",Elementary Forms
41360,purely mythical being. Spencer and Gillen had already mentioned two or,Elementary Forms
41360,three totems of this sort. Among the Warramunga and among the Tjingilli,Elementary Forms
41360,there are clans which bear the name of an ancestor named Thaballa who,Elementary Forms
41360,seems to be gaiety incarnate.[234] Another Warramunga clan bears the,Elementary Forms
41360,"name of a huge fabulous serpent named Wollunqua, from which the clan",Elementary Forms
41360,considers itself descended.[235] We owe other similar facts to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow.[236] In any case, it is easy enough to see what probably took",Elementary Forms
41360,place. Under the influence of diverse causes and by the very development,Elementary Forms
41360,"of mythological thought, the collective and impersonal totem became",Elementary Forms
41360,effaced before certain mythical personages who advanced to the first,Elementary Forms
41360,rank and became totems themselves.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Howsoever interesting these different irregularities may be, they",Elementary Forms
41360,contain nothing which forces us to modify our definition of a totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,"They are not, as has sometimes been believed,[237] different varieties",Elementary Forms
41360,of totems which are more or less irreducible into each other or into the,Elementary Forms
41360,"normal totem, such as we have defined it. They are merely secondary and",Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes even aberrant forms of a single notion which is much more,Elementary Forms
41360,"general, and there is every ground for believing it the more primitive.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The manner in which the name is acquired is more important for the,Elementary Forms
41360,organization and recruiting of the clan than for religion; it belongs to,Elementary Forms
41360,the sociology of the family rather than to religious sociology.[238] So,Elementary Forms
41360,we shall confine ourselves to indicating summarily the most essential,Elementary Forms
41360,principles which regulate the matter.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the different tribes, three different systems are in use.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a great number, or it might even be said, in the greater number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the societies, the child takes the totem of its mother, by right of",Elementary Forms
41360,birth: this is what happens among the Dieri and the Urabunna of the,Elementary Forms
41360,centre of Southern Australia; the Wotjobaluk and the Gournditch-Mara of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Victoria; the Kamilaroi, the Wiradjuri, the Wonghibon and the Euahlayi",Elementary Forms
41360,"of New South Wales; and the Wakelbura, the Pitta-Pitta and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kurnandaburi of Queensland, to mention only the most important names. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"this case, owing to a law of exogamy, the mother is necessarily of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"different totem from her husband, and on the other hand, as she lives in",Elementary Forms
41360,"his community, the members of a single totem are necessarily dispersed",Elementary Forms
41360,in different localities according to the chances of their marriages. As,Elementary Forms
41360,"a result, the totemic group lacks a territorial base.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Elsewhere the totem is transmitted in the paternal line. In this case,",Elementary Forms
41360,"if the child remains with his father, the local group is largely made up",Elementary Forms
41360,of people belonging to a single totem; only the married women there,Elementary Forms
41360,"represent foreign totems. In other words, each locality has its",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular totem. Up until recent times, this scheme of organization was",Elementary Forms
41360,found in Australia only among the tribes where totemism was in,Elementary Forms
41360,"decadence, such as the Narrinyeri, where the totem has almost no",Elementary Forms
41360,religious character at all any more.[239] It was therefore possible to,Elementary Forms
41360,believe that there was a close connection between the totemic system and,Elementary Forms
41360,"descent in the uterine line. But Spencer and Gillen have observed, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the northern part of central Australia, a whole group of tribes where",Elementary Forms
41360,the totemic religion is still practised but where the transmission of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totem is in the paternal line: these are the Warramunga, the Quanji,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Umbia, the Binbinga, the Mara and the Anula.[240]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, a third combination is the one observed among the Arunta and",Elementary Forms
41360,Loritja. Here the totem of the child is not necessarily either that of,Elementary Forms
41360,the mother or that of the father; it is that of a mythical ancestor who,Elementary Forms
41360,"came, by processes which the observers recount in different ways,[241]",Elementary Forms
41360,and mysteriously fecundated the mother at the moment of conception. A,Elementary Forms
41360,special process makes it possible to learn which ancestor it was and to,Elementary Forms
41360,which totemic group he belonged.[242] But since it was only chance which,Elementary Forms
41360,"determined that this ancestor happened to be near the mother, rather",Elementary Forms
41360,"than another, the totem of the child is thus found to depend finally",Elementary Forms
41360,upon fortuitous circumstances.[243],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Outside of and above the totems of clans there are totems of phratries,Elementary Forms
41360,"which, though not differing from the former in nature, must none the",Elementary Forms
41360,less be distinguished from them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A phratry is a group of clans which are united to each other by,Elementary Forms
41360,particular bonds of fraternity. Ordinarily the Australian tribe is,Elementary Forms
41360,divided into two phratries between which the different clans are,Elementary Forms
41360,distributed. Of course there are some tribes where this organization has,Elementary Forms
41360,"disappeared, but everything leads us to believe that it was once",Elementary Forms
41360,"general. In any case, there are no tribes in Australia where the number",Elementary Forms
41360,of phratries is greater than two.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now in nearly all the cases where the phratries have a name whose,Elementary Forms
41360,"meaning has been established, this name is that of an animal; it would",Elementary Forms
41360,therefore seem that it is a totem. This has been well demonstrated in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"recent work by A. Lang.[244] Thus, among the Gournditch (Victoria), the",Elementary Forms
41360,phratries are called Krokitch and Kaputch; the former of the words,Elementary Forms
41360,designates the white cockatoo and the latter the black cockatoo.[245],Elementary Forms
41360,The same expressions are found again among the Buandik and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wotjobaluk.[246] Among the Wurunjerri, the names employed are Bunjil and",Elementary Forms
41360,"Waang, which designate the eagle-hawk and the crow.[247] The words",Elementary Forms
41360,Mukwara and Kilpara are used for the same purpose in a large number of,Elementary Forms
41360,tribes of New South Wales;[248] they designate the same birds.[249] It,Elementary Forms
41360,is also the eagle-hawk and the crow which have given their names to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"two phratries of the Ngarigo and the Wolgal.[250] Among the Kuinmurbura,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is the white cockatoo and the crow.[251] Many other examples might be,Elementary Forms
41360,cited. Thus we are led to regard the phratry as an ancient clan which,Elementary Forms
41360,has been dismembered; the actual clans are the product of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"dismemberment, and the solidarity which unites them is a souvenir of",Elementary Forms
41360,"their primitive unity.[252] It is true that in certain tribes, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratries no longer have special names, as it seems; in others where",Elementary Forms
41360,"these names exist, their meaning is no longer known, even to the",Elementary Forms
41360,members. But there is nothing surprising in this. The phratries are,Elementary Forms
41360,"certainly a primitive institution, for they are everywhere in a state of",Elementary Forms
41360,regression; their descendants the clans have passed to the first rank.,Elementary Forms
41360,So it is but natural that the names which they bore should have been,Elementary Forms
41360,"effaced from memory little by little, when they were no longer",Elementary Forms
41360,understood; for they must belong to a very archaic language no longer in,Elementary Forms
41360,use. This is proved by the fact that in many cases where we know the,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal whose name the phratry bears, the word designating this animal in",Elementary Forms
41360,the current language is very different from the one employed here.[253],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Between the totem of the phratry and the totems of the clans there,Elementary Forms
41360,"exists a sort of relation of subordination. In fact, in principle each",Elementary Forms
41360,clan belongs to one and only one phratry; it is very exceptional that it,Elementary Forms
41360,has representatives in the other phratry. This is not met with at all,Elementary Forms
41360,"except among certain central tribes, notably the Arunta;[254] also even",Elementary Forms
41360,"where, owing to disturbing influences, overlappings of this sort have",Elementary Forms
41360,"taken place, the great part of the clan is included entirely within one",Elementary Forms
41360,or the other of the two groups of the tribe; only a small minority is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"be found in the other one.[255] As a rule then, the two phratries do not",Elementary Forms
41360,"overlap each other; consequently, the list of totems which an individual",Elementary Forms
41360,may have is predetermined by the phratry to which he belongs. In other,Elementary Forms
41360,"words, the phratry is like a species of which the clans are varieties.",Elementary Forms
41360,We shall presently see that this comparison is not purely metaphorical.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In addition to the phratries and clans, another secondary group is",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently met with in Australian societies, which is not without a",Elementary Forms
41360,certain individuality: these are the matrimonial classes.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By this name they designate certain subdivisions of the phratry, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,number varies with the tribe: there are sometimes two and sometimes four,Elementary Forms
41360,per phratry.[256] Their recruiting and operation are regulated by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"two following principles. In the first place, each generation in a",Elementary Forms
41360,phratry belongs to different clans from the immediately preceding one.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus, when there are only two classes per phratry, they necessarily",Elementary Forms
41360,alternate with each other every generation. The children make up the,Elementary Forms
41360,class of which their parents are not members; but grandchildren are of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same class as their grandparents. Thus, among the Kamilaroi, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kupathin phratry has two classes, Ippai and Kumbo; the Dilby phratry,",Elementary Forms
41360,two others which are called Murri and Kubbi. As descent is in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"uterine line, the child is in the phratry of its mother; if she is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kupathin, the child will be one also. But if she is of the Ippai class,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he will be a Kumbo; if the child is a girl, her children will again be",Elementary Forms
41360,in the Ippai class.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Likewise, the children of the women of the Murri class will be in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kubbi class, and the children of the Kubbi women will be Murri again.",Elementary Forms
41360,"When there are four classes per phratry, instead of two, the system is",Elementary Forms
41360,"naturally more complex, but the principle is the same. The four classes",Elementary Forms
41360,"form two couples of two classes each, and these two classes alternate",Elementary Forms
41360,"with each other every generation in the manner just indicated. Secondly,",Elementary Forms
41360,the members of one class can in principle[257] marry into only one of,Elementary Forms
41360,the classes of the other phratry. The Ippai must marry into the Kubbi,Elementary Forms
41360,class and the Murri into the Kumbo class. It is because this,Elementary Forms
41360,organization profoundly affects matrimonial relations that we give the,Elementary Forms
41360,group the name of matrimonial class.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now it may be asked whether these classes do not sometimes have totems,Elementary Forms
41360,like the phratries and clans.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This question is raised by the fact that in certain tribes of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Queensland, each matrimonial class has dietetic restrictions that are",Elementary Forms
41360,peculiar to it. The individuals who compose it must abstain from eating,Elementary Forms
41360,the flesh of certain animals which the others may consume freely.[258],Elementary Forms
41360,Are these animals not totems?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But dietetic restrictions are not the characteristic marks of totemism.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The totem is a name first of all, and then, as we shall see, an emblem.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Now in the societies of which we just spoke, there are no matrimonial",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes which bear the name of an animal or plant, or which have an",Elementary Forms
41360,emblem.[259] Of course it is possible that these restrictions are,Elementary Forms
41360,indirectly derived from totemism. It might be supposed that the animals,Elementary Forms
41360,which these interdictions protect were once the totems of clans which,Elementary Forms
41360,"have since disappeared, while the matrimonial classes remained. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,certain that they have a force of endurance which the clans do not have.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Then these interdictions, deprived of their original field, may have",Elementary Forms
41360,"spread themselves out over the entire class, since there were no other",Elementary Forms
41360,groups to which they could be attached. But it is clear that if this,Elementary Forms
41360,"regulation was born of totemism, it represents only an enfeebled and",Elementary Forms
41360,denatured form of it.[260],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,All that has been said of the totem in Australian societies is equally,Elementary Forms
41360,applicable to the Indian tribes of North America. The only difference is,Elementary Forms
41360,"that among these latter, the totemic organization has a strictness of",Elementary Forms
41360,outline and a stability which are not found in Australia. The Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,"clans are not only very numerous, but in a single tribe their number is",Elementary Forms
41360,"almost unlimited. Observers cite some of them as examples, but without",Elementary Forms
41360,ever succeeding in giving us a complete list. This is because the list,Elementary Forms
41360,is never definitely terminated. The same process of dismemberment which,Elementary Forms
41360,broke up the original phratries and give birth to clans properly,Elementary Forms
41360,so-called still continues within these latter; as a result of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"progressive crumbling, a clan frequently has only a very small effective",Elementary Forms
41360,"force.[261] In America, on the contrary, the totemic system has better",Elementary Forms
41360,defined forms. Although the tribes there are considerably larger on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"average, the clans are less numerous. A single tribe rarely has more",Elementary Forms
41360,"than a dozen of them,[262] and frequently less; each of them is",Elementary Forms
41360,"therefore a much more important group. But above all, their number is",Elementary Forms
41360,"fixed; they know their exact number, and they it tell to us.[263]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This difference is due to the superiority of their social economy. From,Elementary Forms
41360,"the moment when these tribes were observed for the first time, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"social groups were strongly attached to the soil, and consequently",Elementary Forms
41360,better able to resist the decentralizing forces which assailed them. At,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same time, the society had too keen a sentiment of its unity to",Elementary Forms
41360,remain unconscious of itself and of the parts out of which it was,Elementary Forms
41360,composed. The example of America thus enables us to explain even better,Elementary Forms
41360,the organization at the base of the clans. We would take a mistaken,Elementary Forms
41360,"view, if we judged this only on the present conditions in Australia. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, it is in a state of change and dissolution there, which is not at",Elementary Forms
41360,all normal; it is much rather the product of a degeneration which we,Elementary Forms
41360,"see, due both to the natural decay of time and the disorganizing effect",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the whites. To be sure, it is hardly probable that the Australian",Elementary Forms
41360,clans ever had the dimensions and solid structure of the American ones.,Elementary Forms
41360,But there must have been a time when the distance between them was less,Elementary Forms
41360,"considerable than it is to-day, for the American societies would never",Elementary Forms
41360,have succeeded in making so solid a structure if the clans had always,Elementary Forms
41360,been of so fluid and inconsistent a nature.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This greater stability has even enabled the archaic system of phratries,Elementary Forms
41360,to maintain itself in America with a clearness and a relief no longer to,Elementary Forms
41360,be found in Australia. We have just seen that in the latter continent,Elementary Forms
41360,the phratry is everywhere in a state of decadence; very frequently it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"nothing more than an anonymous group; when it has a name, this is either",Elementary Forms
41360,"no longer understood, or in any case, it cannot mean a great deal to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"native, since it is borrowed from a foreign language, or from one no",Elementary Forms
41360,longer spoken. Thus we have been able to infer the existence of totems,Elementary Forms
41360,"for phratries only from a few survivals, which, for the most part, are",Elementary Forms
41360,so slightly marked that they have escaped the attention of many,Elementary Forms
41360,"observers. In certain parts of America, on the contrary, this",Elementary Forms
41360,institution has retained its primitive importance. The tribes of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"North-west coast, the Tlinkit and the Haida especially, have now",Elementary Forms
41360,attained a relatively advanced civilization; yet they are divided into,Elementary Forms
41360,two phratries which are subdivided into a certain number of clans: the,Elementary Forms
41360,"phratries of the Crow and the Wolf among the Tlinkit,[264] of the Eagle",Elementary Forms
41360,and the Crow among the Haida.[265] And this division is not merely,Elementary Forms
41360,nominal; it corresponds to an ever-existing state of tribal customs and,Elementary Forms
41360,is deeply marked with the tribal life. The moral distance separating the,Elementary Forms
41360,clans is very slight in comparison with that separating the,Elementary Forms
41360,phratries.[266] The name of each is not a word whose sense is forgotten,Elementary Forms
41360,or only vaguely known; it is a totem in the full sense of the term; they,Elementary Forms
41360,"have all its essential attributes, such as will be described below.[267]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Consequently, upon this point also, American tribes must not be",Elementary Forms
41360,"neglected, for we can study the totems of phratries directly there,",Elementary Forms
41360,while Australia offers only obscure vestiges of them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But the totem is not merely a name; it is an emblem, a veritable",Elementary Forms
41360,coat-of-arms whose analogies with the arms of heraldry have often been,Elementary Forms
41360,"remarked. In speaking of the Australians, Grey says, ""each family adopt",Elementary Forms
41360,"an animal or vegetable as their crest and sign,""[268] and what Grey",Elementary Forms
41360,"calls a family is incontestably a clan. Also Fison and Howitt say, ""the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian divisions show that the totem is, in the first place, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"badge of a group.""[269] Schoolcraft says the same thing about the totems",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Indians of North America. ""The totem is in fact a design which",Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponds to the heraldic emblems of civilized nations, and each",Elementary Forms
41360,person is authorized to bear it as a proof of the identity of the family,Elementary Forms
41360,"to which it belongs. This is proved by the real etymology of the word,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is derived from _dodaim_, which means village or the residence of",Elementary Forms
41360,"a family group.""[270] Thus when the Indians entered into relations with",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Europeans and contracts were formed between them, it was with its",Elementary Forms
41360,totem that each clan sealed the treaties thus concluded.[271],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The nobles of the feudal period carved, engraved and designed in every",Elementary Forms
41360,"way their coats-of-arms upon the walls of their castles, their arms, and",Elementary Forms
41360,every sort of object that belonged to them; the blacks of Australia and,Elementary Forms
41360,the Indians of North America do the same thing with their totems. The,Elementary Forms
41360,Indians who accompanied Samuel Hearne painted their totems on their,Elementary Forms
41360,"shields before going into battle.[272] According to Charlevoix, in time",Elementary Forms
41360,"of war, certain tribes of Indians had veritable ensigns, made of bits of",Elementary Forms
41360,"bark fastened to the end of a pole, upon which the totems were",Elementary Forms
41360,"represented.[273] Among the Tlinkit, when a conflict breaks out between",Elementary Forms
41360,"two clans, the champions of the two hostile groups wear helmets over",Elementary Forms
41360,"their heads, upon which are painted their respective totems.[274] Among",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Iroquois, they put the skin of the animal which serves as totem upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"each wigwam, as a mark of the clan.[275] According to another observer,",Elementary Forms
41360,the animal was stuffed and set up before the door.[276] Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wyandot, each clan has its own ornaments and its distinctive",Elementary Forms
41360,"paintings.[277] Among the Omaha, and among the Sioux generally, the",Elementary Forms
41360,totem is painted on the tent.[278],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wherever the society has become sedentary, where the tent is replaced by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the house, and where the plastic arts are more fully developed, the",Elementary Forms
41360,totem is engraved upon the woodwork and upon the walls. This is what,Elementary Forms
41360,"happens, for example, among the Haida, the Tsimshian, the Salish and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Tlinkit. ""A very particular ornament of the house, among the Tlinkit,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"says Krause, ""is the totemic coat-of-arms."" Animal forms, sometimes",Elementary Forms
41360,"combined with human forms, are engraved upon the posts at the sides of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the door of entry, which are as high as 15 yards; they are generally",Elementary Forms
41360,"painted with very bright colours.[279] However, these totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,decorations are not very numerous in the Tlinkit village; they are found,Elementary Forms
41360,almost solely before the houses of the chiefs and rich men. They are,Elementary Forms
41360,much more frequent in the neighbouring tribe of the Haida; here there,Elementary Forms
41360,are always several for each house.[280] With its many sculptured posts,Elementary Forms
41360,"arising on every hand, sometimes to a great height, a Haida village",Elementary Forms
41360,"gives the impression of a sacred city, all bristling with belfries or",Elementary Forms
41360,"little minarets.[281] Among the Salish, the totem is frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"represented upon the interior walls of the house.[282] Elsewhere, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"found upon the canoes, the utensils of every sort and the funeral",Elementary Forms
41360,piles.[283],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The preceding examples are taken exclusively from the Indians of North,Elementary Forms
41360,"America. This is because sculpture, engravings and permanent figurations",Elementary Forms
41360,are not possible except where the technique of the plastic arts has,Elementary Forms
41360,reached a degree of perfection to which the Australian tribes have not,Elementary Forms
41360,yet attained. Consequently the totemic representations of the sort which,Elementary Forms
41360,we just mentioned are rarer and less apparent in Australia than in,Elementary Forms
41360,"America. However, cases of them are cited. Among the Warramunga, at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"end of the burial ceremonies, the bones of the dead man are interred,",Elementary Forms
41360,after they have been dried and reduced to powder; beside the place where,Elementary Forms
41360,"they are deposited, a figure representing the totem is traced upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ground.[284] Among the Mara and the Anula, the body is placed in a piece",Elementary Forms
41360,of hollow wood decorated with designs characteristic of the totem.[285],Elementary Forms
41360,"In New South Wales, Oxley found engravings upon the trees near the tomb",Elementary Forms
41360,where a native was buried[286] to which Brough Smyth attributes a,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic character. The natives of the Upper Darling carve totemic images,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon their shields.[287] According to Collins, nearly all the utensils",Elementary Forms
41360,are covered with ornaments which probably have the same significance;,Elementary Forms
41360,figures of the same sort are found upon the rocks.[288] These totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"designs may even be more frequent than it seems, for, owing to reasons",Elementary Forms
41360,"which will be discussed below, it is not always easy to see what their",Elementary Forms
41360,real meaning is.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These different facts give us an idea of the considerable place held by,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totem in the social life of the primitives. However, up to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"present, it has appeared to us as something relatively outside of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"man, for it is only upon external things that we have seen it",Elementary Forms
41360,represented. But totemic images are not placed only upon the walls of,Elementary Forms
41360,"their houses, the sides of their canoes, their arms, their utensils and",Elementary Forms
41360,their tombs; they are also found on the bodies of the men. They do not,Elementary Forms
41360,"put their coat-of-arms merely upon the things which they possess, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"they put it upon their persons; they imprint it upon their flesh, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"becomes a part of them, and this world of representations is even by",Elementary Forms
41360,far the more important one.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, it is a very general rule that the members of each clan seek to",Elementary Forms
41360,give themselves the external aspect of their totem. At certain religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"festivals among the Tlinkit, the person who is to direct the ceremonies",Elementary Forms
41360,"wears a garment which represents, either wholly or in part, the body of",Elementary Forms
41360,the animal whose name he bears.[289] These same usages are also found in,Elementary Forms
41360,all the North-West of America.[290] They are found again among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Minnitaree, when they go into combat,[291] and among the Indians of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Pueblos.[292] Elsewhere, when the totem is a bird, men wear the feathers",Elementary Forms
41360,"of this bird on their heads.[293] Among the Iowa, each clan has a",Elementary Forms
41360,"special fashion of cutting the hair. In the Eagle clan, two large tufts",Elementary Forms
41360,"are arranged on the front of the head, while there is another one",Elementary Forms
41360,"behind; in the Buffalo clan, they are arranged in the form of",Elementary Forms
41360,"horns.[294] Among the Omaha, analogous arrangements are found: each clan",Elementary Forms
41360,"has its own head-dress. In the Turtle clan, for example, the hair is all",Elementary Forms
41360,"shaved off, except six bunches, two on each side of the head, one in",Elementary Forms
41360,"front, and one behind, in such a way as to imitate the legs, the head",Elementary Forms
41360,and the tail of the animal.[295],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is more frequently upon the body itself that the totemic mark is,Elementary Forms
41360,stamped: for this is a way of representation within the capacity of even,Elementary Forms
41360,the least advanced societies. It has sometimes been asked whether the,Elementary Forms
41360,common rite of knocking out a young man's two upper teeth at the age of,Elementary Forms
41360,puberty does not have the object of reproducing the form of the totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The fact is not established, but it is worth mentioning that the natives",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves sometimes explain the custom thus. For example, among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta, the extraction of teeth is practised only in the clans of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rain and of water; now according to tradition, the object of this",Elementary Forms
41360,operation is to make their faces look like certain black clouds with,Elementary Forms
41360,"light borders which are believed to announce the speedy arrival of rain,",Elementary Forms
41360,and which are therefore considered things of the same family.[296] This,Elementary Forms
41360,is a proof that the native himself is conscious that the object of these,Elementary Forms
41360,"deformations is to give him, at least conventionally, the aspect of his",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem. Among these same Arunta, in the course of the rites of",Elementary Forms
41360,"sub-incision, certain gashes are cut upon the sisters and the future",Elementary Forms
41360,"wife of the novice; scars result from these, whose form is also",Elementary Forms
41360,represented upon a certain sacred object of which we shall speak,Elementary Forms
41360,"presently and which is called the _churinga_; as we shall see, the lines",Elementary Forms
41360,thus drawn upon the _churinga_ are emblematic of the totem.[297] Among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Kaitish, the euro is believed to be closely connected with the",Elementary Forms
41360,rain;[298] the men of the rain clan wear little ear-rings made of euro,Elementary Forms
41360,"teeth.[299] Among the Yerkla, during the initiation the young man is",Elementary Forms
41360,given a certain number of slashes which leave scars; the number and form,Elementary Forms
41360,of these varies with the totems.[300] An informer of Fison mentions the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same fact in the tribes observed by him.[301] According to Howitt, a",Elementary Forms
41360,relationship of the same sort exists among the Dieri between certain,Elementary Forms
41360,arrangements of scars and the water totem.[302] Among the Indians of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"North-West, it is a very general custom for them to tattoo themselves",Elementary Forms
41360,with the totem.[303],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But even if the tattooings which are made by mutilations or scars do not,Elementary Forms
41360,"always have a totemic significance,[304] it is different with simple",Elementary Forms
41360,designs drawn upon the body: they are generally representations of the,Elementary Forms
41360,totem. It is true that the native does not carry them every day. When he,Elementary Forms
41360,"is occupied with purely economic occupations, or when the small family",Elementary Forms
41360,"groups scatter to hunt or fish, he does not bother with all this",Elementary Forms
41360,"paraphernalia, which is quite complicated. But when the clans unite to",Elementary Forms
41360,"live a common life and to assist at the religious ceremonies together,",Elementary Forms
41360,"then he must adorn himself. As we shall see, each of the ceremonies",Elementary Forms
41360,"concerns a particular totem, and in theory the rites which are connected",Elementary Forms
41360,with a totem can be performed only by the men of that totem. Now those,Elementary Forms
41360,"who perform,[305] who take the part of officiants, and sometimes even",Elementary Forms
41360,"those who assist as spectators, always have designs representing the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem on their bodies.[306] One of the principal rites of initiation, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"which a young man enters into the religious life of the tribe, consists",Elementary Forms
41360,in painting the totemic symbol on his body.[307] It is true that among,Elementary Forms
41360,the Arunta the design thus traced does not always and necessarily,Elementary Forms
41360,"represent the totem of the initiated;[308] but these are exceptions,",Elementary Forms
41360,"due, undoubtedly, to the disturbed state of the totemic organization of",Elementary Forms
41360,"this tribe.[309] Also, even among the Arunta, at the most solemn moment",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the initiation, which is its crown and consecration, when the",Elementary Forms
41360,neophyte is allowed to enter the sanctuary where all the sacred objects,Elementary Forms
41360,"belonging to the clan are preserved, an emblematic painting is placed",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon him; this time, it is the totem of the young man which is thus",Elementary Forms
41360,represented.[310] The bonds which unite the individual to his totem are,Elementary Forms
41360,even so strong that in the tribes on the North-west coast of North,Elementary Forms
41360,"America, the emblem of the clan is painted not only upon the living but",Elementary Forms
41360,"also upon the dead: before a corpse is interred, they put the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,mark upon it.[311],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These totemic decorations enable us to see that the totem is not merely,Elementary Forms
41360,a name and an emblem. It is in the course of the religious ceremonies,Elementary Forms
41360,that they are employed; they are a part of the liturgy; so while the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem is a collective label, it also has a religious character. In fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is in connection with it, that things are classified as sacred or",Elementary Forms
41360,profane. It is the very type of sacred thing.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The tribes of Central Australia, especially the Arunta, the Loritja, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kaitish, the Unmatjera, and the Ilpirra,[312] make constant use of",Elementary Forms
41360,certain instruments in their rites which are called the _churinga_ by,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Arunta, according to Spencer and Gillen, or the _tjurunga_,",Elementary Forms
41360,according to Strehlow.[313] They are pieces of wood or bits of polished,Elementary Forms
41360,"stone, of a great variety of forms, but generally oval or oblong.[314]",Elementary Forms
41360,Each totemic group has a more or less important collection of these.,Elementary Forms
41360,_Upon each of these is engraved a design representing the totem of this,Elementary Forms
41360,same group._[315] A certain number of the churinga have a hole at one,Elementary Forms
41360,"end, through which goes a thread made of human hair or that of an",Elementary Forms
41360,opossum. Those which are made of wood and are pierced in this way serve,Elementary Forms
41360,for exactly the same purposes as those instruments of the cult to which,Elementary Forms
41360,"English ethnographers have given the name of ""bull-roarers."" By means of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the thread by which they are suspended, they are whirled rapidly in the",Elementary Forms
41360,air in such a way as to produce a sort of humming identical with that,Elementary Forms
41360,made by the toys of this name still used by our children; this deafening,Elementary Forms
41360,noise has a ritual significance and accompanies all ceremonies of any,Elementary Forms
41360,importance. These sorts of churinga are real bull-roarers. But there are,Elementary Forms
41360,others which are not made of wood and are not pierced; consequently they,Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot be employed in this way. Nevertheless, they inspire the same",Elementary Forms
41360,religious sentiments.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, every churinga, for whatever purpose it may be employed, is",Elementary Forms
41360,counted among the eminently sacred things; there are none which surpass,Elementary Forms
41360,it in religious dignity. This is indicated even by the word which is,Elementary Forms
41360,used to designate them. It is not only a substantive but also an,Elementary Forms
41360,"adjective meaning sacred. Also, among the several names which each",Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta has, there is one so sacred that it must not be revealed to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"stranger; it is pronounced but rarely, and then in a low voice and a",Elementary Forms
41360,sort of mysterious murmur. Now this name is called the _aritna churinga_,Elementary Forms
41360,"(aritna means name).[316] In general, the word churinga is used to",Elementary Forms
41360,"designate all ritual acts; for example, _ilia churinga_ signifies the",Elementary Forms
41360,"cult of the emu.[317] Churinga, when used substantively, therefore",Elementary Forms
41360,designates the thing whose essential characteristic is sacredness.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Profane persons, that is to say, women and young men not yet initiated",Elementary Forms
41360,"into the religious life, may not touch or even see the churinga; they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are only allowed to look at it from a distance, and even this is only on",Elementary Forms
41360,rare occasions.[318],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The churinga are piously kept in a special place, which the Arunta call",Elementary Forms
41360,the _ertnatulunga_.[319] This is a cave or a sort of cavern hidden in a,Elementary Forms
41360,deserted place. The entrance is carefully closed by means of stones so,Elementary Forms
41360,cleverly placed that a stranger going past it could not suspect that the,Elementary Forms
41360,religious treasury of the clan was so near to him. The sacred character,Elementary Forms
41360,of the churinga is so great that it communicates itself to the locality,Elementary Forms
41360,where they are stored: the women and the uninitiated cannot approach it.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is only after their initiation is completely finished that the young,Elementary Forms
41360,men have access to it: there are some who are not esteemed worthy of,Elementary Forms
41360,this favour except after years of trial.[320] The religious nature,Elementary Forms
41360,radiates to a distance and communicates itself to all the surroundings:,Elementary Forms
41360,everything near by participates in this same nature and is therefore,Elementary Forms
41360,withdrawn from profane touch. Is one man pursued by another? If he,Elementary Forms
41360,"succeeds in reaching the ertnatulunga, he is saved; he cannot be seized",Elementary Forms
41360,there.[321] Even a wounded animal which takes refuge there must be,Elementary Forms
41360,"respected.[322] Quarrels are forbidden there. It is a place of peace, as",Elementary Forms
41360,is said in the Germanic societies; it is a sanctuary of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"group, it is a veritable place of asylum.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the virtues of the churinga are not manifested merely by the way in,Elementary Forms
41360,"which it keeps the profane at a distance. If it is thus isolated, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,because it is something of a high religious value whose loss would,Elementary Forms
41360,injure the group and the individuals severely. It has all sorts of,Elementary Forms
41360,"marvellous properties: by contact it heals wounds, especially those",Elementary Forms
41360,resulting from circumcision;[323] it has the same power over,Elementary Forms
41360,sickness;[324] it is useful for making the beard grow;[325] it confers,Elementary Forms
41360,"important powers over the totemic species, whose normal reproduction it",Elementary Forms
41360,"ensures;[326] it gives men force, courage and perseverance, while, on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the other hand, it depresses and weakens their enemies. This latter",Elementary Forms
41360,belief is so firmly rooted that when two combatants stand pitted against,Elementary Forms
41360,"one another, if one sees that the other has brought churinga against",Elementary Forms
41360,"him, he loses confidence and his defeat is certain.[327] Thus there is",Elementary Forms
41360,no ritual instrument which has a more important place in the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies.[328] By means of various sorts of anointings, their powers",Elementary Forms
41360,are communicated either to the officiants or to the assistants; to bring,Elementary Forms
41360,"this about, they are rubbed over the members and stomach of the faithful",Elementary Forms
41360,after being covered with grease;[329] or sometimes they are covered with,Elementary Forms
41360,a down which flies away and scatters itself in every direction when they,Elementary Forms
41360,are whirled; this a way of disseminating the virtues which are in,Elementary Forms
41360,them.[330],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But they are not useful merely to individuals; the fate of the clan as a,Elementary Forms
41360,whole is bound up with theirs. Their loss is a disaster; it is the,Elementary Forms
41360,greatest misfortune which can happen to the group.[331] Sometimes they,Elementary Forms
41360,"leave the ertnatulunga, for example when they are loaned to other",Elementary Forms
41360,"groups.[332] Then follows a veritable public mourning. For two weeks,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the people of the totem weep and lament, covering their bodies with",Elementary Forms
41360,white clay just as they do when they have lost a relative.[333] And the,Elementary Forms
41360,churinga are not left at the free disposition of everybody; the,Elementary Forms
41360,ertnatulunga where they are kept is placed under the control of the,Elementary Forms
41360,chief of the group. It is true that each individual has special rights,Elementary Forms
41360,"to some of them;[334] yet, though he is their proprietor in a sense, he",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot make use of them except with the consent and under the direction,Elementary Forms
41360,of the chief. It is a collective treasury; it is the sacred ark of the,Elementary Forms
41360,clan.[335] The devotion of which they are the object shows the high,Elementary Forms
41360,price that is attached to them. The respect with which they are handled,Elementary Forms
41360,"is shown by the solemnity of the movements.[336] They are taken care of,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are greased, rubbed, polished, and when they are moved from one",Elementary Forms
41360,"locality to another, it is in the midst of ceremonies which bear witness",Elementary Forms
41360,to the fact that this displacement is regarded as an act of the highest,Elementary Forms
41360,importance.[337],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now in themselves, the churinga are objects of wood and stone like all",Elementary Forms
41360,others; they are distinguished from profane things of the same sort by,Elementary Forms
41360,only one particularity: this is that the totemic mark is drawn or,Elementary Forms
41360,engraved upon them. So it is this mark and this alone which gives them,Elementary Forms
41360,"their sacred character. It is true that according to Spencer and Gillen,",Elementary Forms
41360,the churinga serve as the residence of an ancestor's soul and that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,the presence of this soul which confers these properties.[338] While,Elementary Forms
41360,"declaring this interpretation inexact, Strehlow, in his turn, proposes",Elementary Forms
41360,another which does not differ materially from the other: he claims that,Elementary Forms
41360,"the churinga are considered the image of the ancestor's body, or the",Elementary Forms
41360,"body itself.[339] So, in any case, it would be sentiments inspired by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ancestor which fix themselves upon the material object, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"convert it into a sort of fetish. But in the first place, both",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceptions,--which, by the way, scarcely differ except in the letter of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the myth,--have obviously been made up afterwards, to account for the",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred character of the churinga. In the constitution of these pieces of,Elementary Forms
41360,"wood and bits of stone, and in their external appearance, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing which predestines them to be considered the seat of an ancestral,Elementary Forms
41360,"soul, or the image of his body. So if men have imagined this myth, it",Elementary Forms
41360,was in order to explain the religious respect which these things,Elementary Forms
41360,"inspired in them, and the respect was not determined by the myth. This",Elementary Forms
41360,"explanation, like so many mythological explanations, resolves the",Elementary Forms
41360,question only by repeating it in slightly different terms; for saying,Elementary Forms
41360,that the churinga is sacred and saying that it has such and such a,Elementary Forms
41360,"relation with a sacred being, is merely to proclaim the same fact in two",Elementary Forms
41360,"different ways; it is not accounting for them. Moreover, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the avowal of Spencer and Gillen, there are some churinga among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta which are made by the old men of the group, to the knowledge of",Elementary Forms
41360,and before the eyes of all;[340] these obviously do not come from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"great ancestors. However, except for certain differences of degree, they",Elementary Forms
41360,have the same power as the others and are preserved in the same manner.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, there are whole tribes where the churinga is never associated",Elementary Forms
41360,"with a spirit.[341] Its religious nature comes to it, then, from some",Elementary Forms
41360,"other source, and whence could it come, if not from the totemic stamp",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it bears? It is to this image, therefore, that the demonstrations",Elementary Forms
41360,of the rite are really addressed; it is this which sanctifies the object,Elementary Forms
41360,upon which it is carved.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Arunta and the neighbouring tribes, there are two other",Elementary Forms
41360,liturgical instruments closely connected with the totem and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"churinga itself, which ordinarily enters into their composition: they",Elementary Forms
41360,are the _nurtunja_ and the _waninga_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The nurtunja,[342] which is found among the northern Arunta and their",Elementary Forms
41360,"immediate neighbours,[343] is made up principally of a vertical support",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is either a single lance, or several lances united into a bundle,",Elementary Forms
41360,or of a simple pole.[344] Bunches of grass are fastened all around it by,Elementary Forms
41360,"means of belts or little cords made of hair. Above this, down is placed,",Elementary Forms
41360,arranged either in circles or in parallel lines which run from the top,Elementary Forms
41360,to the bottom of the support. The top is decorated with the plumes of an,Elementary Forms
41360,eagle-hawk. This is only the most general and typical form; in,Elementary Forms
41360,"particular cases, it has all sorts of variations.[345]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The waninga, which is found only among the southern Arunta, the Urabunna",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the Loritja, has no one unique model either. Reduced to its most",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential elements, it too consists in a vertical support, formed by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"long stick or by a lance several yards high, with sometimes one and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sometimes two cross-pieces.[346] In the former case, it has the",Elementary Forms
41360,appearance of a cross. Cords made either of human hair or opossum or,Elementary Forms
41360,bandicoot fur diagonally cross the space included between the arms of,Elementary Forms
41360,the cross and the extremities of the central axis; as they are quite,Elementary Forms
41360,"close to each other, they form a network in the form of a lozenge. When",Elementary Forms
41360,"there are two cross-bars, these cords go from one to the other and from",Elementary Forms
41360,these to the top and bottom of the support. They are sometimes covered,Elementary Forms
41360,"with a layer of down, thick enough to conceal the foundation. Thus the",Elementary Forms
41360,waninga has the appearance of a veritable flag.[347],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now the nurtunja and the waninga, which figure in a multitude of",Elementary Forms
41360,"important rites, are the object of a religious respect quite like that",Elementary Forms
41360,inspired by the churinga. The process of their manufacture and erection,Elementary Forms
41360,"is conducted with the greatest solemnity. Fixed in the earth, or carried",Elementary Forms
41360,"by an officiant, they mark the central point of the ceremony: it is",Elementary Forms
41360,about them that the dances take place and the rites are performed. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"the course of the initiation, the novice is led to the foot of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"nurtunja erected for the occasion. Someone says to him, ""There is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"nurtunja of your father; many young men have already been made by it.""",Elementary Forms
41360,"After that, the initiate must kiss the nurtunja.[348] By this kiss, he",Elementary Forms
41360,enters into relations with the religious principle which resides there;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is a veritable communion which should give the young man the force,Elementary Forms
41360,required to support the terrible operation of sub-incision.[349] The,Elementary Forms
41360,nurtunja also plays a considerable role in the mythology of these,Elementary Forms
41360,societies. The myths relate that in the fabulous times of the great,Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestors, the territory of the tribe was overrun in every direction by",Elementary Forms
41360,companies composed exclusively of individuals of the same totem.[350],Elementary Forms
41360,"Each of these troops had a nurtunja with it. When it stopped to camp,",Elementary Forms
41360,"before scattering to hunt, the members fixed their nurtunja in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ground, from the top of which their churinga was suspended.[351] That is",Elementary Forms
41360,equivalent to saying that they confided the most precious things they,Elementary Forms
41360,had to it. It was at the same time a sort of standard which served as a,Elementary Forms
41360,rallying-centre for the group. One cannot fail to be struck by the,Elementary Forms
41360,analogies between the nurtunja and the sacred post of the Omaha.[352],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now its sacred character can come from only one cause: that is that it,Elementary Forms
41360,represents the totem materially. The vertical lines or rings of down,Elementary Forms
41360,"which cover it, and even the cords of different colours which fasten the",Elementary Forms
41360,"arms of the waninga to the central axis, are not arranged arbitrarily,",Elementary Forms
41360,according to the taste of the makers; they must conform to a type,Elementary Forms
41360,"strictly determined by tradition which, in the minds of the natives,",Elementary Forms
41360,"represents the totem.[353] Here we cannot ask, as we did in the case of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the churinga, whether the veneration accorded to this instrument of the",Elementary Forms
41360,cult is not merely the reflex of that inspired by the ancestors; for it,Elementary Forms
41360,is a rule that each nurtunja and each waninga last only during the,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremony where they are used. They are made all over again every time,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is necessary, and when the rite is once accomplished, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,stripped of their ornaments and the elements out of which they are made,Elementary Forms
41360,are scattered.[354] They are nothing more than images--and temporary,Elementary Forms
41360,"images at that--of the totem, and consequently it is on this ground,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and on this ground alone, that they play a religious role.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So the churinga, the nurtunja and the waninga owe their religious nature",Elementary Forms
41360,solely to the fact that they bear the totemic emblem. It is the emblem,Elementary Forms
41360,"that is sacred. It keeps this character, no matter where it may be",Elementary Forms
41360,represented. Sometimes it is painted upon rocks; these paintings are,Elementary Forms
41360,"called _churinga ilkinia_, sacred drawings.[355] The decorations with",Elementary Forms
41360,which the officiants and assistants at the religious ceremonies adorn,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves have the same name: women and children may not see them.[356],Elementary Forms
41360,"In the course of certain rites, the totem is drawn upon the ground. The",Elementary Forms
41360,way in which this is done bears witness to the sentiments inspired by,Elementary Forms
41360,"this design, and the high value attributed to it; it is traced upon a",Elementary Forms
41360,"place that has been previously sprinkled, and saturated with human",Elementary Forms
41360,"blood,[357] and we shall presently see that the blood is in itself a",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred liquid, serving for pious uses only. When the design has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"made, the faithful remain seated on the ground before it, in an attitude",Elementary Forms
41360,of the purest devotion.[358] If we give the word a sense corresponding,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the mentality of the primitive, we may say that they adore it. This",Elementary Forms
41360,enables us to understand how the totemic blazon has remained something,Elementary Forms
41360,very precious for the Indians of North America: it is always surrounded,Elementary Forms
41360,with a sort of religious halo.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if we are seeking to understand how it comes that these totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"representations are so sacred, it is not without interest to see what",Elementary Forms
41360,they consist in.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Indians of North America, they are painted, engraved or carved",Elementary Forms
41360,images which attempt to reproduce as faithfully as possible the external,Elementary Forms
41360,aspect of the totemic animal. The means employed are those which we use,Elementary Forms
41360,"to-day in similar circumstances, except that they are generally cruder.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But it is not the same in Australia, and it is in the Australian",Elementary Forms
41360,societies that we must seek the origin of these representations.,Elementary Forms
41360,Although the Australian may show himself sufficiently capable of,Elementary Forms
41360,"imitating the forms of things in a rudimentary way,[359] sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,representations generally seem to show no ambitions in this line: they,Elementary Forms
41360,"consist essentially in geometrical designs drawn upon the churinga, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"nurtunga, rocks, the ground, or the human body. They are either straight",Elementary Forms
41360,"or curved lines, painted in different ways,[360] and the whole having",Elementary Forms
41360,only a conventional meaning. The connection between the figure and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"thing represented is so remote and indirect that it cannot be seen,",Elementary Forms
41360,except when it is pointed out. Only the members of the clan can say what,Elementary Forms
41360,meaning is attached to such and such combinations of lines.[361] Men and,Elementary Forms
41360,"women are generally represented by semicircles, and animals by whole",Elementary Forms
41360,"circles or spirals,[362] the tracks of men or animals by lines of",Elementary Forms
41360,"points, etc. The meaning of the figures thus obtained is so arbitrary",Elementary Forms
41360,that a single design may have two different meanings for the men of two,Elementary Forms
41360,"different totems, representing one animal here, and another animal or",Elementary Forms
41360,plant there. This is perhaps still more apparent with the nurtunja and,Elementary Forms
41360,waninga. Each of them represents a different totem. But the few and,Elementary Forms
41360,simple elements which enter into their composition do not allow a great,Elementary Forms
41360,variety of combinations. The result is that two nurtunja may have,Elementary Forms
41360,"exactly the same appearance, and yet express two things as different as",Elementary Forms
41360,"a gum tree and an emu.[363] When a nurtunja is made, it is given a",Elementary Forms
41360,"meaning which it keeps during the whole ceremony, but which, in the last",Elementary Forms
41360,"resort, is fixed by convention.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These facts prove that if the Australian is so strongly inclined to,Elementary Forms
41360,"represent his totem, it is in order not to have a portrait of it before",Elementary Forms
41360,his eyes which would constantly renew the sensation of it; it is merely,Elementary Forms
41360,because he feels the need of representing the idea which he forms of it,Elementary Forms
41360,"by means of material and external signs, no matter what these signs may",Elementary Forms
41360,be. We are not yet ready to attempt to understand what has thus caused,Elementary Forms
41360,the primitive to write his idea of his totem upon his person and upon,Elementary Forms
41360,"different objects, but it is important to state at once the nature of",Elementary Forms
41360,the need which has given rise to these numerous representations.[364],Elementary Forms

41360,But totemic images are not the only sacred things. There are real things,Elementary Forms
41360,"which are also the object of rites, because of the relations which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"have with the totem: before all others, are the beings of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,species and the members of the clan.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"First of all, since the designs which represent the totem arouse",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious sentiments, it is natural that the things whose aspect these",Elementary Forms
41360,"designs reproduce should have this same property, at least to a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,degree.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"For the most part, these are animals or plants. The profane function of",Elementary Forms
41360,vegetables and even of animals is ordinarily to serve as food; then the,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred character of the totemic animal or plant is shown by the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,that it is forbidden to eat them. It is true that since they are sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, they can enter into the composition of certain mystical repasts,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and we shall see, in fact, that they sometimes serve as veritable",Elementary Forms
41360,sacraments; yet normally they cannot be used for everyday consumption.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Whoever oversteps this rule, exposes himself to grave dangers. It is not",Elementary Forms
41360,that the group always intervenes to punish this infraction artificially;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is believed that the sacrilege produces death automatically. A,Elementary Forms
41360,"redoubtable principle is held to reside in the totemic plant or animal,",Elementary Forms
41360,which cannot enter into the profane organism without disorganizing it or,Elementary Forms
41360,"destroying it.[365] In certain tribes at least, only the old men are",Elementary Forms
41360,free from this prohibition;[366] we shall see the reason for this later.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, if this prohibition is formal in a large number of",Elementary Forms
41360,tribes[367]--with certain exceptions which will be mentioned later--it,Elementary Forms
41360,is incontestable that it tends to weaken as the old totemic organization,Elementary Forms
41360,is disturbed. But the restrictions which remain even then prove that,Elementary Forms
41360,"these attenuations are not admitted without difficulty. For example,",Elementary Forms
41360,"when it is permitted to eat the plant or animal that serves as totem, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is not possible to do so freely; only a little bit may be taken at a,Elementary Forms
41360,time. To go beyond this amount is a ritual fault that has grave,Elementary Forms
41360,"consequences.[368] Elsewhere, the prohibition remains intact for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"parts that are regarded as the most precious, that is to say, as the",Elementary Forms
41360,"most sacred; for example, the eggs or the fat.[369] In still other",Elementary Forms
41360,"parts, consumption is not allowed except when the animal in question has",Elementary Forms
41360,"not yet reached full maturity.[370] In this case, they undoubtedly think",Elementary Forms
41360,that its sacred character is not yet complete. So the barrier which,Elementary Forms
41360,isolates and protects the totemic being yields but slowly and with,Elementary Forms
41360,"active resistance, which bears witness to what it must have been at",Elementary Forms
41360,first.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that according to Spencer and Gillen these restrictions are,Elementary Forms
41360,not the remnants of what was once a rigorous prohibition now losing,Elementary Forms
41360,"hold, but the beginnings of an interdiction which is only commencing to",Elementary Forms
41360,establish itself. These writers hold[371] that at first there was a,Elementary Forms
41360,complete liberty of consumption and that the limitations which were,Elementary Forms
41360,presently brought are relatively recent. They think they find the proof,Elementary Forms
41360,"of their theory in the two following facts. In the first place, as we",Elementary Forms
41360,"just said, there are solemn occasions when the members of the clan or",Elementary Forms
41360,"their chief not only may, but must eat the totemic animal or plant.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the myths relate that the great ancestors, the founders of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clans, ate their totems regularly: now, it is said, these stories cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,be understood except as an echo of a time when the present prohibitions,Elementary Forms
41360,did not exist.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the fact that in the course of certain solemn ceremonies a,Elementary Forms
41360,"consumption of the totem, and a moderate one at that, is ritually",Elementary Forms
41360,required in no way implies that it was once an ordinary article of food.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Quite on the contrary, the food that one eats at a mystical repast is",Elementary Forms
41360,"essentially sacred, and consequently forbidden to the profane. As for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the myths, a somewhat summary critical method is employed, if they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"so readily given the value of historical documents. In general, their",Elementary Forms
41360,object is to interpret existing rites rather than to commemorate past,Elementary Forms
41360,events; they are an explanation of the present much more than a history.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In this case, the traditions according to which the ancestors of the",Elementary Forms
41360,fabulous epoch ate their totem are in perfect accord with the beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,and rites which are always in force. The old men and those who have,Elementary Forms
41360,attained a high religious dignity are freed from the restrictions under,Elementary Forms
41360,which ordinary men are placed:[372] they can eat the sacred thing,Elementary Forms
41360,because they are sacred themselves; this rule is in no way peculiar to,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism, but it is found in all the most diverse religions. Now the",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestral heroes were nearly gods. It is therefore still more natural,Elementary Forms
41360,that they should eat the sacred food;[373] but that is no reason why the,Elementary Forms
41360,same privilege should be awarded to the simple profane.[374],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it is neither certain nor even probable that the prohibition",Elementary Forms
41360,was ever absolute. It seems to have always been suspended in case of,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity, as, for example, when a man is famished and has nothing else",Elementary Forms
41360,with which to nourish himself.[375] A stronger reason for this is found,Elementary Forms
41360,when the totem is a form of nourishment which a man cannot do without.,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus there are a great many tribes where water is a totem; a strict,Elementary Forms
41360,"prohibition is manifestly impossible in this case. However, even here,",Elementary Forms
41360,the privilege granted is submitted to certain restrictions which greatly,Elementary Forms
41360,limit its use and which show clearly that it goes against a recognized,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle. Among the Kaitish and the Warramunga, a man of this totem is",Elementary Forms
41360,not allowed to drink water freely; he may not take it up himself; he may,Elementary Forms
41360,receive it only from the hands of a third party who must belong to the,Elementary Forms
41360,phratry of which he is not a member.[376] The complexity of this,Elementary Forms
41360,procedure and the embarrassment which results from it are still another,Elementary Forms
41360,proof that access to the sacred thing is not free. This same rule is,Elementary Forms
41360,"applied in certain central tribes every time that the totem is eaten,",Elementary Forms
41360,whether from necessity or any other cause. It should also be added that,Elementary Forms
41360,"when this formality is not possible, that is, when a man is alone or",Elementary Forms
41360,"with members of his own phratry only, he may, on necessity, do without",Elementary Forms
41360,an intermediary. It is clear that the prohibition is susceptible of,Elementary Forms
41360,various moderations.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nevertheless, it rests upon ideas so strongly ingrained in the mind that",Elementary Forms
41360,it frequently survives its original cause for being. We have seen that,Elementary Forms
41360,"in all probability, the different clans of a phratry are only",Elementary Forms
41360,subdivisions of one original clan which has been dismembered. So there,Elementary Forms
41360,"was a time when all the clans, being welded together, had the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem; consequently, wherever the souvenir of this common origin is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"completely effaced, each clan continues to feel itself united to the",Elementary Forms
41360,others and to consider that their totems are not completely foreign to,Elementary Forms
41360,it. For this reason an individual may not eat freely of the totems held,Elementary Forms
41360,by the different clans of the phratry of which he is a member; he may,Elementary Forms
41360,touch them only if the forbidden plant or animal is given him by a,Elementary Forms
41360,member of the other phratry.[377],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Another survival of the same sort is the one concerning the maternal,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem. There are strong reasons for believing that at first, the totem",Elementary Forms
41360,"was transmitted in the uterine line. Therefore, wherever descent in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"paternal line has been introduced, this probably took place only after a",Elementary Forms
41360,"long period, during which the opposite principle was applied and the",Elementary Forms
41360,child had the totem of his mother along with all the restrictions,Elementary Forms
41360,attached to it. Now in certain tribes where the child inherits the,Elementary Forms
41360,"paternal totem to-day, some of the interdictions which originally",Elementary Forms
41360,protected the totem of his mother still survive: he cannot eat it,Elementary Forms
41360,"freely.[378] In the present state of affairs, however, there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,longer anything corresponding to this prohibition.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,To this prohibition of eating is frequently added that of killing the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem, or picking it, when it is a plant.[379] However, here also there",Elementary Forms
41360,are exceptions and tolerations. These are especially in the case of,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity, when the totem is a dangerous animal,[380] for example, or",Elementary Forms
41360,when the man has nothing to eat. There are even tribes where men are,Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden to hunt the animals whose names they bear, on their own",Elementary Forms
41360,"accounts, but where they may kill them for others.[381] But the way in",Elementary Forms
41360,which this act is generally accomplished clearly indicates that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"something illicit. One excuses himself as though for a fault, and bears",Elementary Forms
41360,witness to the chagrin which he suffers and the repugnance which he,Elementary Forms
41360,"feels,[382] while precautions are taken that the animal may suffer as",Elementary Forms
41360,little as possible.[383],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In addition to these fundamental interdictions, certain cases of a",Elementary Forms
41360,prohibition of contact between a man and his totem are cited. Thus among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Omaha, in the clan of the Elk, no one may touch any part of the body",Elementary Forms
41360,"of a male elk; in the sub-clan of the Buffalo, no one is allowed to",Elementary Forms
41360,"touch the head of this animal.[384] Among the Bechuana, no man dares to",Elementary Forms
41360,clothe himself in the skin of his totem.[385] But these cases are rare;,Elementary Forms
41360,"and it is natural that they should be exceptional, for normally a man",Elementary Forms
41360,must wear the image of his totem or something which brings it to mind.,Elementary Forms
41360,The tattooings and the totemic costumes would not be possible if all,Elementary Forms
41360,contact were forbidden. It has also been remarked that this prohibition,Elementary Forms
41360,"has not been found in Australia, but only in those societies where",Elementary Forms
41360,totemism has advanced far from its original form; it is therefore,Elementary Forms
41360,probably of late origin and due perhaps to the influence of ideas that,Elementary Forms
41360,are really not totemic at all.[386],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If we now compare these various interdictions with those whose object is,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic emblem, contrarily to all that could be foreseen, it appears",Elementary Forms
41360,"that these latter are more numerous, stricter, and more severely",Elementary Forms
41360,enforced than the former. The figures of all sorts which represent the,Elementary Forms
41360,totem are surrounded with a respect sensibly superior to that inspired,Elementary Forms
41360,"by the very being whose form these figures reproduce. The churinga, the",Elementary Forms
41360,nurtunja and the waninga can never be handled by the women or the,Elementary Forms
41360,"uninitiated, who are even allowed to catch glimpses of it only very",Elementary Forms
41360,"exceptionally, and from a respectful distance. On the other hand, the",Elementary Forms
41360,plant or animal whose name the clan bears may be seen and touched by,Elementary Forms
41360,"everybody. The churinga are preserved in a sort of temple, upon whose",Elementary Forms
41360,threshold all noises from the profane life must cease; it is the domain,Elementary Forms
41360,"of sacred things. On the contrary, the totemic animals and plants live",Elementary Forms
41360,in the profane world and are mixed up with the common everyday life.,Elementary Forms
41360,Since the number and importance of the interdictions which isolate a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred thing, and keep it apart, correspond to the degree of sacredness",Elementary Forms
41360,"with which it is invested, we arrive at the remarkable conclusion that",Elementary Forms
41360,_the images of totemic beings are more sacred than the beings,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves_. Also, in the ceremonies of the cult, it is the churinga and",Elementary Forms
41360,the nurtunja which have the most important place; the animal appears,Elementary Forms
41360,"there only very exceptionally. In a certain rite, of which we shall have",Elementary Forms
41360,"occasion to speak,[387] it serves as the substance for a religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"repast, but it plays no active role. The Arunta dance around the",Elementary Forms
41360,"nurtunja, and assemble before the image of their totem to adore it, but",Elementary Forms
41360,a similar demonstration is never made before the totemic being itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,"If this latter were the primarily sacred object, it would be with it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the sacred animal or plant, that the young initiate would communicate",Elementary Forms
41360,when he is introduced into the religious life; but we have seen that on,Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, the most solemn moment of the initiation is the one when",Elementary Forms
41360,the novice enters into the sanctuary of the churinga. It is with them,Elementary Forms
41360,and the nurtunja that he communicates. The representations of the totem,Elementary Forms
41360,are therefore more actively powerful than the totem itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We must now determine the place of man in the scheme of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By the force of a whole group of acquired habits and of language itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"we are inclined to consider the common man, the simple believer, as an",Elementary Forms
41360,essentially profane being. It may well happen that this conception is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not literally true for any religion;[388] in any case, it is not",Elementary Forms
41360,applicable to totemism. Every member of the clan is invested with a,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred character which is not materially inferior to that which we just,Elementary Forms
41360,observed in the animal. This personal sacredness is due to the fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,"the man believes that while he is a man in the usual sense of the word,",Elementary Forms
41360,he is also an animal or plant of the totemic species.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, he bears its name; this identity of name is therefore supposed",Elementary Forms
41360,to imply an identity of nature. The first is not merely considered as an,Elementary Forms
41360,outward sign of the second; it supposes it logically. This is because,Elementary Forms
41360,"the name, for a primitive, is not merely a word or a combination of",Elementary Forms
41360,"sounds; it is a part of the being, and even something essential to it. A",Elementary Forms
41360,"member of the Kangaroo clan calls himself a kangaroo; he is therefore,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in one sense, an animal of this species. ""The totem of any man,"" say",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen, ""is regarded as the same thing as himself; a native",Elementary Forms
41360,"once said to us when we were discussing the matter with him, 'That one,'",Elementary Forms
41360,"pointing to his photograph which we had taken, 'is the same thing as me:",Elementary Forms
41360,"so is a kangaroo' (his totem).""[389] So each individual has a double",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature: two beings coexist within him, a man and an animal.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In order to give a semblance of intelligibility to this duality, so",Elementary Forms
41360,"strange for us, the primitive has invented myths which, it is true,",Elementary Forms
41360,"explain nothing and only shift the difficulty, but which, by shifting",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, seem at least to lessen the logical scandal. With slight variations",Elementary Forms
41360,"of detail, all are constructed on the same plan: their object is to",Elementary Forms
41360,establish genealogical connections between the man and the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal, making the one a relative of the other. By this common origin,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which, by the way, is represented in various manners, they believe that",Elementary Forms
41360,"they account for their common nature. The Narrinyeri, for example, have",Elementary Forms
41360,imagined that certain of the first men had the power of transforming,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves into beasts.[390] Other Australian societies place at the,Elementary Forms
41360,beginning of humanity either strange animals from which the men were,Elementary Forms
41360,"descended in some unknown way,[391] or mixed beings, half-way between",Elementary Forms
41360,"the two kingdoms,[392] or else unformed creatures, hardly representable,",Elementary Forms
41360,"deprived of all determined organs, and even of all definite members, and",Elementary Forms
41360,the different parts of whose bodies were hardly outlined.[393] Mythical,Elementary Forms
41360,"powers, sometimes conceived under the form of animals, then intervened",Elementary Forms
41360,and made men out of these ambiguous and innumerable beings which Spencer,Elementary Forms
41360,"and Gillen say represent ""stages in the transformation of animals and",Elementary Forms
41360,"plants into human beings.""[394] These transformations are represented to",Elementary Forms
41360,"us under the form of violent and, as it were, surgical operations. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,"under the blows of an axe or, if the operator is a bird, blows of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"beak, that the human individual was carved out of this shapeless mass,",Elementary Forms
41360,"his members separated from each other, his mouth opened and his nostrils",Elementary Forms
41360,"pierced.[395] Analogous legends are found in America, except that owing",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the more highly developed mentality of these peoples, the",Elementary Forms
41360,representations which they employ do not contain confusions so,Elementary Forms
41360,"troublesome for the mind. Sometimes it is a legendary personage who, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"an act of his power, metamorphosed the animal who gives its name to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clan into a man.[396] Sometimes the myth attempts to explain how, by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"series of nearly natural events and a sort of spontaneous evolution, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal transformed himself little by little, and finally took a human",Elementary Forms
41360,form.[397],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is true that there are societies (the Haida, Tlinkit, Tsimshian)",Elementary Forms
41360,where it is no longer admitted that man was born of an animal or plant;,Elementary Forms
41360,but the idea of an affinity between the animals of the totemic species,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the members of the clan has survived there nevertheless, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"expresses itself in myths which, though differing from the preceding,",Elementary Forms
41360,still retain all that is essential in them. Here is one of the,Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental themes. The ancestor who gives his name to the clan is here,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented as a human being, but who, in the course of various",Elementary Forms
41360,"wanderings, has been led to live for a while among the fabulous animals",Elementary Forms
41360,of the very species which gave the clan its name. As the result of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"intimate and prolonged connection, he became so like his new companions",Elementary Forms
41360,"that when he returned to men, they no longer recognized him. He was",Elementary Forms
41360,therefore given the name of the animal which he resembled. It is from,Elementary Forms
41360,"his stay in this mythical land that he brought back the totemic emblem,",Elementary Forms
41360,together with the powers and virtues believed to be attached to it.[398],Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus in this case, as in the others, men are believed to participate in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the nature of the animal, though this participation may be conceived in",Elementary Forms
41360,slightly different forms.[399],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So man also has something sacred about him. Though diffused into the,Elementary Forms
41360,"whole organism, this characteristic is especially apparent in certain",Elementary Forms
41360,privileged places. There are organs and tissues that are specially,Elementary Forms
41360,marked out: these are particularly the blood and the hair.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, human blood is so holy a thing that in the tribes of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Central Australia, it frequently serves to consecrate the most respected",Elementary Forms
41360,"instruments of the cult. For example, in certain cases, the nurtunja is",Elementary Forms
41360,regularly anointed from top to bottom with the blood of a man.[400] It,Elementary Forms
41360,"is upon ground all saturated with blood that the men of the Emu, among",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Arunta, trace their sacred images.[401] We shall presently see that",Elementary Forms
41360,streams of blood are poured upon the rocks which represent the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,animals and plants.[402] There is no religious ceremony where blood does,Elementary Forms
41360,"not have some part to play.[403] During the initiation, the adults open",Elementary Forms
41360,their veins and sprinkle the novice with their blood; and this blood is,Elementary Forms
41360,so sacred a thing that women may not be present while it is flowing; the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sight of it is forbidden them, just as the sight of a churinga is.[404]",Elementary Forms
41360,The blood lost by a young initiate during the very violent operations he,Elementary Forms
41360,must undergo has very particular virtues: it is used in various,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies.[405] That which flows during the sub-incision is piously,Elementary Forms
41360,kept by the Arunta and buried in a place upon which they put a piece of,Elementary Forms
41360,wood warning passers-by of the sacredness of the spot; no woman should,Elementary Forms
41360,approach it.[406] The religious nature of blood also explains the equal,Elementary Forms
41360,"importance, religiously, of the red ochre, which is very frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,employed in ceremonies; they rub the churinga with it and use it in,Elementary Forms
41360,ritual decorations.[407] This is due to the fact that because of its,Elementary Forms
41360,"colour, it is regarded as something kindred to blood. Many deposits of",Elementary Forms
41360,red ochre which are found in the Arunta territory are even supposed to,Elementary Forms
41360,be the coagulated blood which certain heroines of the mythical period,Elementary Forms
41360,shed on to the soil.[408],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Hair has similar properties. The natives of the centre wear belts made,Elementary Forms
41360,"of human hair, whose religious functions we have already pointed out:",Elementary Forms
41360,they are also used to wrap up certain instruments of the cult.[409],Elementary Forms
41360,Does one man loan another one of his churinga? As a sign of,Elementary Forms
41360,"acknowledgment, the second makes a present of hair to the first; these",Elementary Forms
41360,two sorts of things are therefore thought to be of the same order and of,Elementary Forms
41360,equivalent value.[410] So the operation of cutting the hair is a ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,"act, accompanied by definite ceremonies: the individual operated upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"must squat on the ground, with his face turned in the direction of the",Elementary Forms
41360,place where the fabulous ancestors from which the clan of his mother is,Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to be descended, are thought to have camped.[411] For the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"reason, as soon as a man is dead, they cut his hair off and put it away",Elementary Forms
41360,"in some distant place, for neither women nor the non-initiated have the",Elementary Forms
41360,"right of seeing it: it is here, far from profane eyes, that the belts",Elementary Forms
41360,are made.[412],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Other organic tissues might be mentioned which have similar properties,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in varying degrees: such are the whiskers, the foreskin, the fat of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"liver, etc.[413] But it is useless to multiply examples. Those already",Elementary Forms
41360,given are enough to prove that there is something in man which holds,Elementary Forms
41360,profane things at a distance and which possesses a religious power; in,Elementary Forms
41360,"other words, the human organism conceals within its depths a sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"principle, which visibly comes to the surface in certain determined",Elementary Forms
41360,cases. This principle does not differ materially from that which causes,Elementary Forms
41360,"the religious character of the totem. In fact, we have just seen that",Elementary Forms
41360,the different substances in which it incarnates itself especially enter,Elementary Forms
41360,"into the ritual composition of the objects of the cult (nurtunja,",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic designs), or else are used in the anointings whose object is to",Elementary Forms
41360,renew the virtues either of the churinga or of the sacred rocks; they,Elementary Forms
41360,are things of the same species.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Sometimes the religious dignity which is inherent in each member of the,Elementary Forms
41360,clan on this account is not equal for all. Men possess it to a higher,Elementary Forms
41360,"degree than women; in relation to them, women are like profane",Elementary Forms
41360,"beings.[414] Thus, every time that there is an assembly, either of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic group or of the tribe, the men have a separate camp, distinct",Elementary Forms
41360,"from that of the women, and into which these latter may not enter: they",Elementary Forms
41360,are separated off.[415] But there are also differences in the way in,Elementary Forms
41360,which men are marked with a religious character. The young men not yet,Elementary Forms
41360,"initiated are wholly deprived of it, since they are not admitted to the",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies. It is among the old men that it reaches its greatest,Elementary Forms
41360,intensity. They are so very sacred that certain things forbidden to,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinary people are permissible for them: they may eat the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal more freely and, as we have seen, there are even some tribes",Elementary Forms
41360,where they are freed from all dietetic restrictions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So we must be careful not to consider totemism a sort of animal worship.,Elementary Forms
41360,The attitude of a man towards the animals or plants whose name he bears,Elementary Forms
41360,"is not at all that of a believer towards his god, for he belongs to the",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred world himself. Their relations are rather those of two beings who,Elementary Forms
41360,are on the same level and of equal value. The most that can be said is,Elementary Forms
41360,"that in certain cases, at least, the animal seems to occupy a slightly",Elementary Forms
41360,more elevated place in the hierarchy of sacred things. It is because of,Elementary Forms
41360,this that it is sometimes called the father or the grandfather of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"men of the clan, which seems to show that they feel themselves in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"state of moral dependence in regard to it.[416] But in other, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"perhaps even more frequent cases, it happens that the expressions used",Elementary Forms
41360,denote rather a sentiment of equality. The totemic animal is called the,Elementary Forms
41360,"friend or the elder brother of its human fellows.[417] Finally, the",Elementary Forms
41360,bonds which exist between them and it are much more like those which,Elementary Forms
41360,unite the members of a single family; the animals and the men are made,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the same flesh, as the Buandik say.[418] On account of this kinship,",Elementary Forms
41360,men regard the animals of the totemic species as kindly associates upon,Elementary Forms
41360,whose aid they think they can rely. They call them to their aid[419] and,Elementary Forms
41360,"they come, to direct their blows in the hunt and to give warning of",Elementary Forms
41360,"whatever dangers there may be.[420] In return for this, men treat them",Elementary Forms
41360,with regard and are never cruel to them;[421] but these attentions in no,Elementary Forms
41360,way resemble a cult.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Men sometimes even appear to have a mysterious sort of property-right,Elementary Forms
41360,over their totems. The prohibition against killing and eating them is,Elementary Forms
41360,"applied only to members of the clan, of course; it could not be extended",Elementary Forms
41360,"to other persons without making life practically impossible. If, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"tribe like the Arunta, where there is such a host of different totems,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it were forbidden to eat, not only the animal or plant whose name one",Elementary Forms
41360,"bears, but also all the animals and all the plants which serve as totems",Elementary Forms
41360,"to other clans, the sources of food would be reduced to nothing. Yet",Elementary Forms
41360,there are tribes where the consumption of the totemic plant or animal is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not allowed without restrictions, even to foreigners. Among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Wakelbura, it must not take place in the presence of men of this",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem.[422] In other places, their permission must be given. For",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, among the Kaitish and the Unmatjera, whenever a man of the Emu",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem happens to be in a place occupied by a grass-seed clan, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"gathers some of these seed, before eating them he must go to the chief",Elementary Forms
41360,"and say to him, ""I have gathered these seeds in your country."" To this",Elementary Forms
41360,"the chief replies, ""All right; you may eat them."" But if the Emu man ate",Elementary Forms
41360,"them before demanding permission, it is believed that he would fall sick",Elementary Forms
41360,and run the risk of dying.[423] There are even cases where the chief of,Elementary Forms
41360,the group must take a little of the food and eat it himself: it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of payment which must be made.[424] For the same reason, the",Elementary Forms
41360,churinga gives the hunter a certain power over the corresponding animal:,Elementary Forms
41360,"by rubbing his body with a Euro churinga, for example, a man acquires a",Elementary Forms
41360,greater chance of catching euros.[425] This is the proof that the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,of participating in the nature of a totemic being confers a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,"eminent right over this latter. Finally, there is one tribe in northern",Elementary Forms
41360,"Queensland, the Karingbool, where the men of the totem are the only ones",Elementary Forms
41360,"who have a right to kill the animal or, if the totem is a tree, to peel",Elementary Forms
41360,off its bark. Their aid is indispensable to all others who want to use,Elementary Forms
41360,the flesh of this animal or the wood of this tree for their own personal,Elementary Forms
41360,"ends.[426] So they appear as proprietors, though it is quite evidently",Elementary Forms
41360,"over a special sort of property, of which we find it hard to form an",Elementary Forms
41360,idea.,Elementary Forms

41360,_The Cosmological System of Totemism and the Idea of Class_,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are beginning to see that totemism is a much more complex religion,Elementary Forms
41360,than it first appeared to be. We have already distinguished three,Elementary Forms
41360,"classes of things which it recognizes as sacred, in varying degrees: the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic emblem, the animal or plant whose appearance this emblem",Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduces, and the members of the clan. However, this list is not yet",Elementary Forms
41360,"complete. In fact, a religion is not merely a collection of fragmentary",Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs in regard to special objects like those we have just been,Elementary Forms
41360,"discussing. To a greater or less extent, all known religions have been",Elementary Forms
41360,"systems of ideas which tend to embrace the universality of things, and",Elementary Forms
41360,to give us a complete representation of the world. If totemism is to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"considered as a religion comparable to the others, it too should offer",Elementary Forms
41360,"us a conception of the universe. As a matter of fact, it does satisfy",Elementary Forms
41360,this condition.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The fact that this aspect of totemism has generally been neglected is,Elementary Forms
41360,due to the too narrow notion of the clan which has been prevalent.,Elementary Forms
41360,Ordinarily it is regarded as a mere group of human beings. Being a,Elementary Forms
41360,"simple subdivision of the tribe, it seems that like this, it is made up",Elementary Forms
41360,"of nothing but men. But in reasoning thus, we substitute our European",Elementary Forms
41360,ideas for those which the primitive has of man and of society. For the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian, things themselves, everything which is in the universe, are",Elementary Forms
41360,"a part of the tribe; they are constituent elements of it and, so to",Elementary Forms
41360,"speak, regular members of it; just like men, they have a determined",Elementary Forms
41360,"place in the general scheme of organization of the society. ""The South",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian savage,"" says Fison, ""looks upon the universe as the Great",Elementary Forms
41360,"Tribe, to one of whose divisions he himself belongs; and all things,",Elementary Forms
41360,"animate and inanimate, which belong to his class are parts of the body",Elementary Forms
41360,"corporate whereof he himself is a part.""[427] As a consequence of this",Elementary Forms
41360,"principle, whenever the tribe is divided into two phratries, all known",Elementary Forms
41360,"things are distributed between them. ""All nature,"" says Palmer, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"speaking of the Bellinger River tribe, ""is also divided into class",Elementary Forms
41360,[phratry] names.... The sun and moon and stars are said ... to belong,Elementary Forms
41360,"to classes [phratries] just as the blacks themselves.""[428] The Port",Elementary Forms
41360,Mackay tribe in Queensland has two phratries with the names Yungaroo and,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wootaroo, as do the neighbouring tribes. Now as Bridgmann says, ""all",Elementary Forms
41360,"things, animate and inanimate, are divided by these tribes into two",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes, named Yungaroo and Wootaroo.""[429] Nor does the classification",Elementary Forms
41360,stop here. The men of each phratry are distributed among a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"number of clans; likewise, the things attributed to each phratry are in",Elementary Forms
41360,their turn distributed among the clans of which the phratry is composed.,Elementary Forms
41360,"A certain tree, for example, will be assigned to the Kangaroo clan, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"to it alone; then, just like the human members of the clan, it will have",Elementary Forms
41360,the Kangaroo as totem; another will belong to the Snake clan; clouds,Elementary Forms
41360,"will be placed under one totem, the sun under another, etc. All known",Elementary Forms
41360,things will thus be arranged in a sort of tableau or systematic,Elementary Forms
41360,classification embracing the whole of nature.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have given a certain number of these classifications elsewhere;[430],Elementary Forms
41360,at present we shall confine ourselves to repeating a few of these as,Elementary Forms
41360,examples. One of the best known of these is the one found in the Mount,Elementary Forms
41360,"Gambier tribe. This tribe includes two phratries, named respectively the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kumite and the Kroki; each of these, in its turn, is subdivided into",Elementary Forms
41360,"five clans. Now ""everything in nature belongs to one or another of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"ten clans"";[431] Fison and Howitt say that they are all ""included""",Elementary Forms
41360,"within it. In fact, they are classified under these ten totems just like",Elementary Forms
41360,species in their respective classes. This is well shown by the following,Elementary Forms

41360,natives. The Wotjobaluk also are divided into two phratries called,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If we remember that there are many other clans (Howitt names twelve and,Elementary Forms
41360,"Mathews fourteen and adds that his list is incomplete[437]), we will",Elementary Forms
41360,understand how all the things in which the native takes an interest find,Elementary Forms
41360,a natural place in these classifications.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Similar arrangements have been observed in the most diverse parts of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Australian continent; in South Australia, in Victoria, and in New",Elementary Forms
41360,South Wales (among the Euahlayi[438]); very clear traces of it are found,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the central tribes.[439] In Queensland, where the clans seem to have",Elementary Forms
41360,disappeared and where the matrimonial classes are the only subdivisions,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the phratry, things are divided up among these classes. Thus, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Wakelbura are divided into two phratries, Mallera and Wutaru; the",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes of the first are called Kurgilla and Banbe, those of the second,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Wungo and Obu. Now to the Banbe belong the opossum, the kangaroo, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"dog, honey of little bees, etc.; to the Wungo are attributed the emu,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the bandicoot, the black duck, the black snake, the brown snake; to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Obu, the carpet snake, the honey of stinging bees, etc.; to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kurgilla, the porcupine, the turkey of the plains, water, rain, fire,",Elementary Forms
41360,"thunder, etc.[440]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This same organization is found among the Indians of North America. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"Zuni have a system of classification which, in its essential lines, is",Elementary Forms
41360,in all points comparable to the one we have just described. That of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Omaha rests on the same principles as that of the Wotjobaluk.[441] An,Elementary Forms
41360,echo of these same ideas survives even into the more advanced societies.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Haida, all the gods and mythical beings who are placed in",Elementary Forms
41360,charge of the different phenomena of nature are classified in one or the,Elementary Forms
41360,other of the two phratries which make up the tribe just like men; some,Elementary Forms
41360,"are Eagles, the others, Crows.[442] Now the gods of things are only",Elementary Forms
41360,another aspect of the things which they govern.[443] This mythological,Elementary Forms
41360,classification is therefore merely another form of the preceding one. So,Elementary Forms
41360,we may rest assured that this way of conceiving the world is independent,Elementary Forms
41360,of all ethnic or geographic particularities; and at the same time it is,Elementary Forms
41360,clearly seen to be closely united to the whole system of totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the paper to which we have already made allusion several times, we",Elementary Forms
41360,have shown what light these facts throw upon the way in which the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,"of kind or class was formed in humanity. In fact, these systematic",Elementary Forms
41360,"classifications are the first we meet with in history, and we have just",Elementary Forms
41360,"seen that they are modelled upon the social organization, or rather that",Elementary Forms
41360,they have taken the forms of society as their framework. It is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"phratries which have served as classes, and the clans as species. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,"because men were organized that they have been able to organize things,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for in classifying these latter, they limited themselves to giving them",Elementary Forms
41360,places in the groups they formed themselves. And if these different,Elementary Forms
41360,"classes of things are not merely put next to each other, but are",Elementary Forms
41360,"arranged according to a unified plan, it is because the social groups",Elementary Forms
41360,"with which they commingle themselves are unified and, through their",Elementary Forms
41360,"union, form an organic whole, the tribe. The unity of these first",Elementary Forms
41360,logical systems merely reproduces the unity of the society. Thus we have,Elementary Forms
41360,an occasion for verifying the proposition which we laid down at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"commencement of this work, and for assuring ourselves that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental notions of the intellect, the essential categories of",Elementary Forms
41360,"thought, may be the product of social factors. The above-mentioned facts",Elementary Forms
41360,show clearly that this is the case with the very notion of category,Elementary Forms
41360,itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it is not our intention to deny that the individual intellect",Elementary Forms
41360,has of itself the power of perceiving resemblances between the different,Elementary Forms
41360,"objects of which it is conscious. Quite on the contrary, it is clear",Elementary Forms
41360,that even the most primitive and simple classifications presuppose this,Elementary Forms
41360,faculty. The Australian does not place things in the same clan or in,Elementary Forms
41360,"different clans at random. For him as for us, similar images attract one",Elementary Forms
41360,"another, while opposed ones repel one another, and it is on the basis of",Elementary Forms
41360,these feelings of affinity or of repulsion that he classifies the,Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding things in one place or another.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There are also cases where we are able to perceive the reasons which,Elementary Forms
41360,inspired this. The two phratries were very probably the original and,Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental bases for these classifications, which were consequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"bifurcate at first. Now, when a classification is reduced to two",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes, these are almost necessarily conceived as antitheses; they are",Elementary Forms
41360,used primarily as a means of clearly separating things between which,Elementary Forms
41360,"there is a very marked contrast. Some are set at the right, the others",Elementary Forms
41360,at the left. As a matter of fact this is the character of the Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,"classifications. If the white cockatoo is in one phratry, the black one",Elementary Forms
41360,"is in the other; if the sun is on one side, the moon and the stars of",Elementary Forms
41360,night are on the opposite side.[444] Very frequently the beings which,Elementary Forms
41360,serve as the totems of the two phratries have contrary colours.[445],Elementary Forms
41360,These oppositions are even met with outside of Australia. Where one of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the phratries is disposed to peace, the other is disposed to war;[446]",Elementary Forms
41360,"if one has water as its totem, the other has earth.[447] This is",Elementary Forms
41360,undoubtedly the explanation of why the two phratries have frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,been thought of as naturally antagonistic to one another. They say that,Elementary Forms
41360,there is a sort of rivalry or even a constitutional hostility between,Elementary Forms
41360,them.[448] This opposition of things has extended itself to persons; the,Elementary Forms
41360,logical contrast has begotten a sort of social conflict.[449],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is also to be observed that within each phratry, those things have",Elementary Forms
41360,been placed in a single clan which seem to have the greatest affinity,Elementary Forms
41360,"with that serving as totem. For example, the moon has been placed with",Elementary Forms
41360,"the black cockatoo, but the sun, together with the atmosphere and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"wind, with the white cockatoo. Or again, to a totemic animal has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"united all that serves him as food,[450] as well as the animals with",Elementary Forms
41360,"which he has the closest connection.[451] Of course, we cannot always",Elementary Forms
41360,understand the obscure psychology which has caused many of these,Elementary Forms
41360,"connections and distinctions, but the preceding examples are enough to",Elementary Forms
41360,show that a certain intuition of the resemblances and differences,Elementary Forms
41360,presented by things has played an important part in the genesis of,Elementary Forms
41360,these classifications.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the feeling of resemblances is one thing and the idea of class is,Elementary Forms
41360,another. The class is the external framework of which objects perceived,Elementary Forms
41360,"to be similar form, in part, the contents. Now the contents cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,furnish the frame into which they fit. They are made up of _vague and,Elementary Forms
41360,"fluctuating_ images, due to the super-imposition and partial fusion of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"_determined number of individual images_, which are found to have common",Elementary Forms
41360,"elements; the framework, on the contrary, is a _definite form_, with",Elementary Forms
41360,"fixed outlines, but which may be applied to an _undetermined number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"things_, perceived or not, actual or possible. In fact, every class has",Elementary Forms
41360,possibilities of extension which go far beyond the circle of objects,Elementary Forms
41360,"which we know, either from direct experience or from resemblance. This",Elementary Forms
41360,"is why every school of thinkers has refused, and not with good reason,",Elementary Forms
41360,to identify the idea of class with that of a generic image. The generic,Elementary Forms
41360,image is only the indistinctly-bounded residual representation left in,Elementary Forms
41360,"us by similar representations, when they are present in consciousness",Elementary Forms
41360,simultaneously; the class is a logical symbol by means of which we think,Elementary Forms
41360,"distinctly of these similarities and of other analogous ones. Moreover,",Elementary Forms
41360,the best proof of the distance separating these two notions is that an,Elementary Forms
41360,animal is able to form generic images though ignorant of the art of,Elementary Forms
41360,thinking in classes and species.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The idea of class is an instrument of thought which has obviously been,Elementary Forms
41360,"constructed by men. But in constructing it, we have at least had need of",Elementary Forms
41360,"a model; for how could this idea ever have been born, if there had been",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing either in us or around us which was capable of suggesting it to,Elementary Forms
41360,us? To reply that it was given to us _a priori_ is not to reply at all;,Elementary Forms
41360,"this lazy man's solution is, as has been said, the death of analysis.",Elementary Forms
41360,But it is hard to see where we could have found this indispensable model,Elementary Forms
41360,"except in the spectacle of the collective life. In fact, a class is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"an ideal, but a clearly defined group of things between which internal",Elementary Forms
41360,"relationships exist, similar to those of kindred. Now the only groups of",Elementary Forms
41360,this sort known from experience are those formed by men in associating,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves. Material things may be able to form collections of units, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"heaps, or mechanical assemblages with no internal unity, but not groups",Elementary Forms
41360,in the sense we have given the word. A heap of sand or a pile of rock is,Elementary Forms
41360,in no way comparable to that variety of definite and organized society,Elementary Forms
41360,"which forms a class. In all probability, we would never have thought of",Elementary Forms
41360,"uniting the beings of the universe into homogeneous groups, called",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes, if we had not had the example of human societies before our",Elementary Forms
41360,"eyes, if we had not even commenced by making things themselves members",Elementary Forms
41360,"of men's society, and also if human groups and logical groups had not",Elementary Forms
41360,been confused at first.[452],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is also to be borne in mind that a classification is a system whose,Elementary Forms
41360,parts are arranged according to a hierarchy. There are dominating,Elementary Forms
41360,members and others which are subordinate to the first; species and their,Elementary Forms
41360,distinctive properties depend upon classes and the attributes which,Elementary Forms
41360,"characterize them; again, the different species of a single class are",Elementary Forms
41360,conceived as all placed on the same level in regard to each other. Does,Elementary Forms
41360,someone prefer to regard them from the point of view of the,Elementary Forms
41360,understanding? Then he represents things to himself in an inverse order:,Elementary Forms
41360,he puts at the top the species that are the most particularized and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"richest in reality, while the types that are most general and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"poorest in qualities are at the bottom. Nevertheless, all are",Elementary Forms
41360,represented in a hierarchic form. And we must be careful not to believe,Elementary Forms
41360,that the expression has only a metaphorical sense here: there are really,Elementary Forms
41360,"relations of subordination and co-ordination, the establishment of which",Elementary Forms
41360,"is the object of all classification, and men would never have thought of",Elementary Forms
41360,arranging their knowledge in this way if they had not known beforehand,Elementary Forms
41360,what a hierarchy was. But neither the spectacle of physical nature nor,Elementary Forms
41360,the mechanism of mental associations could furnish them with this,Elementary Forms
41360,knowledge. The hierarchy is exclusively a social affair. It is only in,Elementary Forms
41360,"society that there are superiors, inferiors and equals. Consequently,",Elementary Forms
41360,"even if the facts were not enough to prove it, the mere analysis of",Elementary Forms
41360,"these ideas would reveal their origin. We have taken them from society,",Elementary Forms
41360,and projected them into our conceptions of the world. It is society that,Elementary Forms
41360,has furnished the outlines which logical thought has filled in.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But these primitive classifications have a no less direct interest for,Elementary Forms
41360,the origins of religious thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,They imply that all the things thus classed in a single clan or a single,Elementary Forms
41360,phratry are closely related both to each other and to the thing serving,Elementary Forms
41360,as the totem of this clan or phratry. When an Australian of the Port,Elementary Forms
41360,"Mackay tribe says that the sun, snakes, etc., are of the Yungaroo",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratry, he does not mean merely to apply a common, but none the less a",Elementary Forms
41360,"purely conventional, nomenclature to these different things; the word",Elementary Forms
41360,"has an objective signification for him. He believes that ""alligators",Elementary Forms
41360,really _are_ Yungaroo and that kangaroos are Wootaroo. The sun _is_,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yungaroo, the moon Wootaroo, and so on for the constellations, trees,",Elementary Forms
41360,"plants, etc.""[453] An internal bond attaches them to the group in which",Elementary Forms
41360,they are placed; they are regular members of it. It is said that they,Elementary Forms
41360,"belong to the group,[454] just exactly as the individual men make a part",Elementary Forms
41360,"of it; consequently, the same sort of a relation unites them to these",Elementary Forms
41360,latter. Men regard the things in their clan as their relatives or,Elementary Forms
41360,associates; they call them their friends and think that they are made,Elementary Forms
41360,"out of the same flesh as themselves.[455] Therefore, between the two",Elementary Forms
41360,there are elective affinities and quite special relations of agreement.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Things and people have a common name, and in a certain way they",Elementary Forms
41360,naturally understand each other and harmonize with one another. For,Elementary Forms
41360,"example, when a Wakelbura of the Mallera phratry is buried, the scaffold",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which the body is exposed ""must be made of the wood of some tree",Elementary Forms
41360,"belonging to the Mallera phratry.""[456] The same is true for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"branches that cover the corpse. If the deceased is of the Banbe class, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"Banbe tree must be used. In this same tribe, a magician can use in his",Elementary Forms
41360,art only those things which belong to his own phratry;[457] since the,Elementary Forms
41360,"others are strangers to him, he does not know how to make them obey him.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus a bond of mystic sympathy unites each individual to those beings,",Elementary Forms
41360,"whether living or not, which are associated with him; the result of this",Elementary Forms
41360,is a belief in the possibility of deducing what he will do or what he,Elementary Forms
41360,"has done from what they are doing. Among these same Wakelbura, when a",Elementary Forms
41360,man dreams that he has killed an animal belonging to a certain social,Elementary Forms
41360,"division, he expects to meet a man of this same division the next",Elementary Forms
41360,"day.[458] Inversely, the things attributed to a clan or phratry cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,be used against the members of this clan or phratry. Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wotjobaluk, each phratry has its own special trees. Now in hunting an",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal of the Gurogity phratry, only arms whose wood is taken from trees",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the other phratry may be used, and _vice versa_; otherwise the hunter",Elementary Forms
41360,is sure to miss his aim.[459] The native is convinced that the arrow,Elementary Forms
41360,"would turn of itself and refuse, so to speak, to hit a kindred and",Elementary Forms
41360,friendly animal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the men of the clan and the things which are classified in it form,Elementary Forms
41360,"by their union a solid system, all of whose parts are united and vibrate",Elementary Forms
41360,"sympathetically. This organization, which at first may have appeared to",Elementary Forms
41360,"us as purely logical, is at the same time moral. A single principle",Elementary Forms
41360,animates it and makes its unity: this is the totem. Just as a man who,Elementary Forms
41360,"belongs to the Crow clan has within him something of this animal, so the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rain, since it is of the same clan and belongs to the same totem, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"also necessarily considered as being ""the same thing as a crow""; for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same reason, the moon is a black cockatoo, the sun a white cockatoo,",Elementary Forms
41360,"every black-nut tree a pelican, etc. All the beings arranged in a single",Elementary Forms
41360,"clan, whether men, animals, plants or inanimate objects, are merely",Elementary Forms
41360,forms of the totemic being. This is the meaning of the formula which we,Elementary Forms
41360,have just cited and this is what makes the two really of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,species: all are really of the same flesh in the sense that all partake,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the nature of the totemic animal. Also, the qualifiers given them are",Elementary Forms
41360,those given to the totem.[460] The Wotjobaluk give the name _Mir_ both,Elementary Forms
41360,to the totem and to the things classed with it.[461] It is true that,Elementary Forms
41360,"among the Arunta, where visible traces of classification still exist, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"we shall see, different words designate the totem and the other beings",Elementary Forms
41360,"placed with it; however, the name given to these latter bears witness to",Elementary Forms
41360,the close relations which unite them to the totemic animal. It is said,Elementary Forms
41360,"that they are its _intimates_, its _associates_, its _friends_; it is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed that they are inseparable from it.[462] So there is a feeling,Elementary Forms
41360,that these are very closely related things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we also know that the totemic animal is a sacred being. All the,Elementary Forms
41360,things that are classified in the clan of which it is the emblem have,Elementary Forms
41360,"this same character, because in one sense, they are animals of the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"species, just as the man is. They, too, are sacred, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,classifications which locate them in relation to the other things of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"universe, by that very act give them a place in the religious world. For",Elementary Forms
41360,"this reason, the animals or plants among these may not be eaten freely",Elementary Forms
41360,"by the human members of the clan. Thus in the Mount Gambier tribe, the",Elementary Forms
41360,men whose totem is a certain non-poisonous snake must not merely refrain,Elementary Forms
41360,"from eating the flesh of this snake; that of seals, eels, etc., is also",Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden to them.[463] If, driven by necessity, they do eat some of it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they must at least attenuate the sacrilege by expiatory rites, just as",Elementary Forms
41360,"if they had eaten the totem itself.[464] Among the Euahlayi, where it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is permitted to use the totem, but not to abuse it, the same rule is",Elementary Forms
41360,"applied to the other members of the clan.[465] Among the Arunta, the",Elementary Forms
41360,interdictions protecting the totemic animal extend over the associated,Elementary Forms
41360,"animals;[466] and in any case, particular attention must be given to",Elementary Forms
41360,these latter.[467] The sentiments inspired by the two are,Elementary Forms
41360,identical.[468],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the fact that the things thus attached to the totem are not of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"different nature from it, and consequently have a religious character,",Elementary Forms
41360,is best proved by the fact that on certain occasions they fulfil the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same functions. They are accessory or secondary totems, or, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,"an expression now consecrated by usage, they are sub-totems.[469] It is",Elementary Forms
41360,constantly happening in the clans that under the influence of various,Elementary Forms
41360,"sympathies, particular affinities are forming, smaller groups and more",Elementary Forms
41360,"limited associations arise, which tend to lead a relatively autonomous",Elementary Forms
41360,life and to form a new subdivision like a sub-clan within the larger,Elementary Forms
41360,"one. In order to distinguish and individualize itself, this sub-clan",Elementary Forms
41360,"needs a special totem or, consequently, a sub-totem.[470] Now the totems",Elementary Forms
41360,of these secondary groups are chosen from among the things classified,Elementary Forms
41360,under the principal totem. So they are always almost totems and the,Elementary Forms
41360,slightest circumstance is enough to make them actually so. There is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"latent totemic nature in them, which shows itself as soon as conditions",Elementary Forms
41360,permit it or demand it. It thus happens that a single individual has,Elementary Forms
41360,"two totems, a principal totem common to the whole clan and a sub-totem",Elementary Forms
41360,which is special to the sub-clan of which he is a member. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,something analogous to the _nomen_ and _cognomen_ of the Romans.[471],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Sometimes we see a sub-clan emancipate itself completely and become an,Elementary Forms
41360,"autonomous group and an independent clan; then, the sub-totem, on its",Elementary Forms
41360,"side, becomes a regular totem. One tribe where this process of",Elementary Forms
41360,"segmentation has been pushed to the limit, so to speak, is the Arunta.",Elementary Forms
41360,The information contained in the first book of Spencer and Gillen showed,Elementary Forms
41360,that there were some sixty totems among the Arunta;[472] but the recent,Elementary Forms
41360,researches of Strehlow have shown the number to be much larger. He,Elementary Forms
41360,counted no less than 442.[473] Spencer and Gillen did not exaggerate at,Elementary Forms
41360,"all when they said, ""In fact, there is scarcely an object, animate or",Elementary Forms
41360,"inanimate, to be found in the country occupied by the natives which does",Elementary Forms
41360,"not give its name to some totemic group.""[474] Now this multitude of",Elementary Forms
41360,"totems, whose number is prodigious when compared to the population, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"due to the fact that under special circumstances, the original clans",Elementary Forms
41360,have divided and sub-divided infinitely; consequently nearly all the,Elementary Forms
41360,sub-totems have passed to the stage of totems.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This has been definitely proved by the observations of Strehlow. Spencer,Elementary Forms
41360,and Gillen cited only certain isolated cases of associated totems.[475],Elementary Forms
41360,Strehlow has shown that this is in reality an absolutely general,Elementary Forms
41360,organization. He has been able to draw up a table where nearly all the,Elementary Forms
41360,totems of the Arunta are classified according to this principle: all are,Elementary Forms
41360,"attached, either as associates or as auxiliaries, to some sixty",Elementary Forms
41360,principal totems.[476] The first are believed to be in the service of,Elementary Forms
41360,the second.[477] This state of dependence is very probably the echo of,Elementary Forms
41360,"a time when the ""allies"" of to-day were only sub-totems, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently when the tribe contained only a small number of clans,Elementary Forms
41360,subdivided into sub-clans. Numerous survivals confirm this hypothesis.,Elementary Forms
41360,It frequently happens that two groups thus associated have the same,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic emblem: now this unity of emblem is explicable only if the two,Elementary Forms
41360,groups were at first only one.[478] The relation of the two clans is,Elementary Forms
41360,also shown by the part and the interest that each one takes in the,Elementary Forms
41360,rites of the other. The two cults are still only imperfectly separated;,Elementary Forms
41360,this is very probably because they were at first completely,Elementary Forms
41360,intermingled.[479] Tradition explains the bonds which unite them by,Elementary Forms
41360,imagining that formerly the two clans occupied neighbouring places.[480],Elementary Forms
41360,"In other cases, the myth says expressly that one of them was derived",Elementary Forms
41360,from the other. It is related that at first the associated animal,Elementary Forms
41360,belonged to the species still serving as principal totem; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"differentiated itself at a later period. Thus the chantunga birds, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"are associated with the witchetly grub to-day, were witchetly grubs in",Elementary Forms
41360,"fabulous times, who later transformed themselves into birds. Two species",Elementary Forms
41360,"which are now attached to the honey-ant were formerly honey-ants,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.[481] This transformation of a sub-totem into a totem goes on by,Elementary Forms
41360,"imperceptible degrees, so that in certain cases the situation is",Elementary Forms
41360,"undecided, and it is hard to say whether one is dealing with a principal",Elementary Forms
41360,totem or a secondary one.[482] As Howitt says in regard to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wotjobaluk, there are sub-totems which are totems in formation.[483]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus the different things classified in a clan constitute, as it were,",Elementary Forms
41360,so many nuclei around which new totemic cults are able to form. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,the best proof of the religious sentiments which they inspire. If they,Elementary Forms
41360,"did not have a sacred character, they could not be promoted so easily to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same dignity as the things which are sacred before all others, the",Elementary Forms
41360,regular totems.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So the field of religious things extends well beyond the limits within,Elementary Forms
41360,which it seemed to be confined at first. It embraces not only the,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic animals and the human members of the clan; but since no known,Elementary Forms
41360,"thing exists that is not classified in a clan and under a totem, there",Elementary Forms
41360,is likewise nothing which does not receive to some degree something of,Elementary Forms
41360,"a religious character. When, in the religions which later come into",Elementary Forms
41360,"being, the gods properly so-called appear, each of them will be set over",Elementary Forms
41360,"a special category of natural phenomena, this one over the sea, that one",Elementary Forms
41360,"over the air, another over the harvest or over fruits, etc., and each of",Elementary Forms
41360,these provinces of nature will be believed to draw what life there is in,Elementary Forms
41360,it from the god upon whom it depends. This division of nature among the,Elementary Forms
41360,different divinities constitutes the conception which these religions,Elementary Forms
41360,give us of the universe. Now so long as humanity has not passed the,Elementary Forms
41360,"phase of totemism, the different totems of the tribe fulfil exactly the",Elementary Forms
41360,same functions that will later fall upon the divine personalities. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Mount Gambier tribe, which we have taken as our principal example,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are ten clans; consequently the entire world is divided into ten,Elementary Forms
41360,"classes, or rather into ten families, each of which has a special totem",Elementary Forms
41360,as its basis. It is from this basis that the things classed in the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,"get all their reality, for they are thought of as variant forms of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic being; to return to our example, the rain, thunder, lightning,",Elementary Forms
41360,"clouds, hail and winter are regarded as different sorts of crows. When",Elementary Forms
41360,"brought together, these ten families of things make up a complete and",Elementary Forms
41360,systematic representation of the world; and this representation is,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious, for religious notions furnish its basis. Far from being",Elementary Forms
41360,"limited to one or two categories of beings, the domain of totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,religion extends to the final limits of the known universe. Just like,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Greek religion, it puts the divine everywhere; the celebrated",Elementary Forms
41360,"formula [Greek: panta plere theon] (everything is full of the gods),",Elementary Forms
41360,might equally well serve it as motto.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, if totemism is to be represented thus, the notion of it which",Elementary Forms
41360,has long been held must be modified on one essential point. Until the,Elementary Forms
41360,"discoveries of recent years, it was made to consist entirely in the cult",Elementary Forms
41360,"of one particular totem, and it was defined as the religion of the clan.",Elementary Forms
41360,"From this point of view, each tribe seemed to have as many totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, each independent of the others, as it had different clans.",Elementary Forms
41360,This conception was also in harmony with the idea currently held of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clan; in fact, this was regarded as an autonomous society,[484] more or",Elementary Forms
41360,"less closed to other similar societies, or having only external and",Elementary Forms
41360,superficial relations with these latter. But the reality is more,Elementary Forms
41360,"complex. Undoubtedly, the cult of each totem has its home in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponding clan; it is there, and only there, that it is celebrated;",Elementary Forms
41360,it is members of the clan who have charge of it; it is through them,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is transmitted from one generation to another, along with the",Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs which are its basis. But it is also true that the different,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic cults thus practised within a single tribe do not have a,Elementary Forms
41360,"parallel development, though remaining ignorant of each other, as if",Elementary Forms
41360,each of them constituted a complete and self-sufficing religion. On the,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, they mutually imply each other; they are only the parts of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"single whole, the elements of a single religion. The men of one clan",Elementary Forms
41360,"never regard the beliefs of neighbouring clans with that indifference,",Elementary Forms
41360,scepticism or hostility which one religion ordinarily inspires for,Elementary Forms
41360,another which is foreign to it; they partake of these beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves. The Crow people are also convinced that the Snake people,Elementary Forms
41360,"have a mythical serpent as ancestor, and that they owe special virtues",Elementary Forms
41360,and marvellous powers to this origin. And have we not seen that at least,Elementary Forms
41360,"in certain conditions, a man may eat a totem that is not his own only",Elementary Forms
41360,"after he has observed certain ritual formalities? Especially, he must",Elementary Forms
41360,"demand the permission of the men of this totem, if any are present. So",Elementary Forms
41360,"for him also, this food is not entirely profane; he also admits that",Elementary Forms
41360,there are intimate affinities between the members of a clan of which he,Elementary Forms
41360,"is not a member and the animal whose name they bear. Also, this",Elementary Forms
41360,community of belief is sometimes shown in the cult. If in theory the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites concerning a totem can be performed only by the men of this totem,",Elementary Forms
41360,nevertheless representatives of different clans frequently assist at,Elementary Forms
41360,them. It sometimes happens that their part is not simply that of,Elementary Forms
41360,"spectators; it is true that they do not officiate, but they decorate the",Elementary Forms
41360,officiants and prepare the service. They themselves have an interest in,Elementary Forms
41360,"its being celebrated; therefore, in certain tribes, it is they who",Elementary Forms
41360,invite the qualified clan to proceed with the ceremonies.[485] There is,Elementary Forms
41360,even a whole cycle of rites which must take place in the presence of the,Elementary Forms
41360,assembled tribe: these are the totemic ceremonies of initiation.[486],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, the totemic organization, such as we have just described it,",Elementary Forms
41360,must obviously be the result of some sort of an indistinct understanding,Elementary Forms
41360,between all the members of the tribe. It is impossible that each clan,Elementary Forms
41360,should have made its beliefs in an absolutely independent manner; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,absolutely necessary that the cults of the different totems should be in,Elementary Forms
41360,"some way adjusted to each other, since they complete one another",Elementary Forms
41360,"exactly. In fact, we have seen that normally a single totem is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"repeated twice in the same tribe, and that the whole universe is divided",Elementary Forms
41360,up among the totems thus constituted in such a way that the same object,Elementary Forms
41360,is not found in two different clans. So methodical a division could,Elementary Forms
41360,"never have been made without an agreement, tacit or planned, in which",Elementary Forms
41360,the whole tribe participated. So the group of beliefs which thus arise,Elementary Forms
41360,are partially (but only partially) a tribal affair.[487],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"To sum up, then, in order to form an adequate idea of totemism, we must",Elementary Forms
41360,"not confine ourselves within the limits of the clan, but must consider",Elementary Forms
41360,the tribe as a whole. It is true that the particular cult of each clan,Elementary Forms
41360,enjoys a very great autonomy; we can now see that it is within the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,that the active ferment of the religious life takes place. But it is,Elementary Forms
41360,also true that these cults fit into each other and the totemic religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"is a complex system formed by their union, just as Greek polytheism was",Elementary Forms
41360,made by the union of all the particular cults addressed to the different,Elementary Forms
41360,"divinities. We have just shown that, thus understood, totemism also has",Elementary Forms

41360,"Up to the present, we have studied totemism only as a public",Elementary Forms

41360,part in them only as a member of a group. But we know that there is no,Elementary Forms
41360,religion which does not have an individual aspect. This general,Elementary Forms
41360,observation is applicable to totemism. In addition to the impersonal and,Elementary Forms
41360,"collective totems which hold the first place, there are others which are",Elementary Forms
41360,"peculiar to each individual, which express his personality, and whose",Elementary Forms

41360,"with some determined object, which are comparable to those which each",Elementary Forms

41360,gentilicium_. It is true that this fact is not reported except in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain number of societies,[491] but it is probably general. In fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,we shall presently show that there is an identity of nature between the,Elementary Forms
41360,individual and the thing; now an identity of nature implies one of name.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Being given in the course of especially important religious ceremonies,",Elementary Forms
41360,this forename has a sacred character. It is not pronounced in the,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinary circumstances of profane life. It even happens that the word,Elementary Forms
41360,designating this object in the ordinary language must be modified to a,Elementary Forms
41360,greater or less extent if it is to serve in this particular case.[492],Elementary Forms
41360,This is because the terms of the usual language are excluded from the,Elementary Forms
41360,religious life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In certain American tribes, at least, this name is reinforced by an",Elementary Forms
41360,"emblem belonging to each individual and representing, under various",Elementary Forms
41360,"forms, the thing designated by the name. For example, each Mandan wears",Elementary Forms
41360,the skin of the animal of which he is the namesake.[493] If it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"bird, he decorates himself with its feathers.[494] The Hurons and",Elementary Forms
41360,Algonquins tattoo their bodies with its image.[495] It is represented on,Elementary Forms
41360,"their arms.[496] Among the north-western tribes, the individual emblem,",Elementary Forms
41360,"just like the collective emblem of the clan, is carved or engraved on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the utensils, houses,[497] etc.; it serves as a mark of ownership.[498]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Frequently the two coats-of-arms are combined together, which partially",Elementary Forms
41360,explains the great diversity of aspects presented by the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,escutcheons among these peoples.[499],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Between the individual and his animal namesake there exist the very,Elementary Forms
41360,closest bonds. The man participates in the nature of the animal; he has,Elementary Forms
41360,"its good qualities as well as its faults. For example, a man having the",Elementary Forms
41360,eagle as his coat-of-arms is believed to possess the gift of seeing into,Elementary Forms
41360,"the future; if he is named after a bear, they say that he is apt to be",Elementary Forms
41360,"wounded in combat, for the bear is heavy and slow and easily",Elementary Forms
41360,"caught;[500] if the animal is despised, the man is the object of the",Elementary Forms
41360,same sentiment.[501] The relationship of the two is even so close that,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is believed that in certain circumstances, especially in case of",Elementary Forms
41360,"danger, the man can take the form of the animal.[502] Inversely, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal is regarded as a double of the man, as his _alter ego_.[503] The",Elementary Forms
41360,association of the two is so close that their destinies are frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,thought to be bound up together: nothing can happen to one without the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other's feeling a reaction.[504] If the animal dies, the life of the man",Elementary Forms
41360,is menaced. Thus it comes to be a very general rule that one should not,Elementary Forms
41360,"kill the animal, nor eat its flesh. This interdiction, which, when",Elementary Forms
41360,"concerning the totem of the clan, allows of all sorts of attenuations",Elementary Forms
41360,"and modifications, is now much more formal and absolute.[505]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"On its side, the animal protects the man and serves him as a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,patron. It informs him of possible dangers and of the way of escaping,Elementary Forms
41360,them;[506] they say that it is his friend.[507] Since it frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,"happens to possess marvellous powers, it communicates them to its human",Elementary Forms
41360,"associate, who believes in them, even under the proof of bullets,",Elementary Forms
41360,"arrows, and blows of every sort.[508] This confidence of an individual",Elementary Forms
41360,in the efficacy of his protector is so great that he braves the greatest,Elementary Forms
41360,dangers and accomplishes the most disconcerting feats with an intrepid,Elementary Forms
41360,serenity: faith gives him the necessary courage and strength.[509],Elementary Forms
41360,"However, the relations of a man with his patron are not purely and",Elementary Forms
41360,"simply those of dependence. He, on his side, is able to act upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal. He gives it orders; he has influence over it. A Kurnai having,Elementary Forms
41360,the shark as ally and friend believes that he can disperse the sharks,Elementary Forms
41360,"who menace a boat, by means of a charm.[510] In other cases, the",Elementary Forms
41360,relations thus contracted are believed to confer upon the man a special,Elementary Forms
41360,aptitude for hunting the animal with success.[511],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The very nature of these relations seems clearly to imply that the being,Elementary Forms
41360,to which each individual is thus associated is only an individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, and not a species. A man does not have a species as his _alter",Elementary Forms
41360,"ego_. In fact, there are cases where it is certainly a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"determined tree, rock or stone that fulfils this function.[512] It must",Elementary Forms
41360,"be thus every time that it is an animal, and that the existences of the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal and the man are believed to be connected. A man could not be,Elementary Forms
41360,"united so closely to a whole species, for there is not a day nor, so to",Elementary Forms
41360,"speak, an instant when the species does not lose some one of its",Elementary Forms
41360,members. Yet the primitive has a certain incapacity for thinking of the,Elementary Forms
41360,individual apart from the species; the bonds uniting him to the one,Elementary Forms
41360,readily extend to the other; he confounds the two in the same sentiment.,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the entire species becomes sacred for him.[513],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This protector is naturally given different names in different,Elementary Forms
41360,"societies: _nagual_ among the Indians of Mexico,[514] _manitou_ among",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Algonquins and _okki_ among the Hurons,[515] _snam_ among certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"Salish,[516] _sulia_ among others,[517] _budjan_ among the Yuin,[518]",Elementary Forms
41360,"_yunbeai_ among the Euahlayi,[519] etc. Owing to the importance of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs and practices among the Indians of North America, some have",Elementary Forms
41360,proposed creating a word _nagualism_ or _manitouism_ to designate,Elementary Forms
41360,"them.[520] But in giving them a special and distinctive name, we run the",Elementary Forms
41360,risk of misunderstanding their relations with the rest of totemism. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, the same principle is applied in the one case to the clan and in",Elementary Forms
41360,the other to the individual. In both cases we find the same belief that,Elementary Forms
41360,"there are vital connections between the things and the men, and that",Elementary Forms
41360,"the former are endowed with special powers, of which their human allies",Elementary Forms
41360,may also enjoy the advantage. We also find the same custom of giving the,Elementary Forms
41360,man the name of the thing with which he is associated and of adding an,Elementary Forms
41360,"emblem to this name. The totem is the patron of the clan, just as the",Elementary Forms
41360,patron of the individual is his personal totem. So it is important that,Elementary Forms
41360,our terminology should make the relationship of the two systems,Elementary Forms
41360,"apparent; that is why we, with Frazer, shall give the name _individual",Elementary Forms
41360,totemism_ to the cult rendered by each individual to his patron. A,Elementary Forms
41360,further justification of this expression is found in the fact that in,Elementary Forms
41360,certain cases the primitive himself uses the same word to designate the,Elementary Forms
41360,totem of the clan and the animal protector of the individual.[521] If,Elementary Forms
41360,Tylor and Powell have rejected this term and demanded different ones for,Elementary Forms
41360,"these two sorts of religious institutions, it is because the collective",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem is, in their opinion, only a name or label, having no religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"character.[522] But we, on the contrary, know that it is a sacred thing,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and even more so than the protecting animal. Moreover, the continuation",Elementary Forms
41360,of our study will show how these two varieties of totemism are,Elementary Forms
41360,inseparable from each other.[523],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yet, howsoever close the kinship between these two institutions may be,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are important differences between them. While the clan believes,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is the offspring of the animal or plant serving it as totem, the",Elementary Forms
41360,individual does not believe that he has any relationship of descent with,Elementary Forms
41360,"his personal totem. It is a friend, an associate, a protector; but it is",Elementary Forms
41360,not a relative. He takes advantage of the virtues it is believed to,Elementary Forms
41360,"possess; but he is not of the same blood. In the second place, the",Elementary Forms
41360,members of a clan allow neighbouring clans to eat of the animal whose,Elementary Forms
41360,"name they bear collectively, under the simple condition that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary formalities shall be observed. But, on the contrary, the",Elementary Forms
41360,individual respects the species to which his personal totem belongs and,Elementary Forms
41360,"also protects it against strangers, at least in those parts where the",Elementary Forms
41360,destiny of the man is held to be bound up with that of the animal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the chief difference between these two sorts of totems is in the,Elementary Forms
41360,manner in which they are acquired.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The collective totem is a part of the civil status of each individual:,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is generally hereditary; in any case, it is birth which designates",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, and the wish of men counts for nothing. Sometimes the child has the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem of his mother (Kamilaroi, Dieri, Urabunna, etc.); sometimes that",Elementary Forms
41360,"of his father (Narrinyeri, Warramunga, etc.); sometimes the one",Elementary Forms
41360,"predominating in the locality where his mother conceived (Arunta,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Loritja). But, on the contrary, the individual totem is acquired by a",Elementary Forms
41360,deliberate act:[524] a whole series of ritual operations are necessary,Elementary Forms
41360,to determine it. The method generally employed by the Indians of North,Elementary Forms
41360,"America is as follows. About the time of puberty, as the time for",Elementary Forms
41360,"initiation approaches, the young man withdraws into a distant place, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, into a forest. There, during a period varying from a few days",Elementary Forms
41360,"to several years, he submits himself to all sorts of exhausting and",Elementary Forms
41360,"unnatural exercises. He fasts, mortifies himself and inflicts various",Elementary Forms
41360,"mutilations upon himself. Now he wanders about, uttering violent cries",Elementary Forms
41360,"and veritable howls; now he lies extended, motionless and lamenting,",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon the ground. Sometimes he dances, prays and invokes his ordinary",Elementary Forms
41360,"divinities. At last, he thus gets himself into an extreme state of",Elementary Forms
41360,"super-excitation, verging on delirium. When he has reached this",Elementary Forms
41360,"paroxysm, his representations readily take on the character of",Elementary Forms
41360,"hallucinations. ""When,"" says Heckewelder, ""a boy is on the eve of being",Elementary Forms
41360,"initiated, he is submitted to an alternating regime of fasts and medical",Elementary Forms
41360,treatment; he abstains from all food and takes the most powerful and,Elementary Forms
41360,"repugnant drugs: at times, he drinks intoxicating concoctions until his",Elementary Forms
41360,"mind really wanders. Then he has, or thinks he has, visions and",Elementary Forms
41360,extraordinary dreams to which he was of course predisposed by all this,Elementary Forms
41360,"training. He imagines himself flying through the air, advancing under",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ground, jumping from one mountain-top to another across the valleys,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and fighting and conquering giants and monsters.""[525] If in these",Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances he sees, or, as amounts to the same thing, he thinks he",Elementary Forms
41360,"sees, while dreaming or while awake, an animal appearing to him in an",Elementary Forms
41360,"attitude seeming to show friendly intentions, then he imagines that he",Elementary Forms
41360,has discovered the patron he awaited.[526],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Yet this procedure is rarely employed in Australia.[527] On this,Elementary Forms
41360,"continent, the personal totem seems to be imposed by a third party,",Elementary Forms
41360,either at birth[528] or at the moment of initiation.[529] Generally it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is a relative who takes this part, or else a personage invested with",Elementary Forms
41360,"special powers, such as an old man or a magician. Sometimes divination",Elementary Forms
41360,"is used for this purpose. For example, on Charlotte Bay, Cape Bedford or",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Proserpine River, the grandmother or some other old woman takes a",Elementary Forms
41360,little piece of umbilical cord to which the placenta is still attached,Elementary Forms
41360,and whirls it about quite violently. Meanwhile the other old women,Elementary Forms
41360,propose different names. That one is adopted which happens to be,Elementary Forms
41360,pronounced just at the moment when the cord breaks.[530] Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yarrai-kanna of Cape York, after a tooth has been knocked out of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"young initiate, they give him a little water to rinse his mouth and ask",Elementary Forms
41360,him to spit in a bucket full of water. The old men carefully examine the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clot formed by the blood and saliva thus spit out, and the natural",Elementary Forms
41360,object whose shape it resembles becomes the personal totem of the young,Elementary Forms
41360,"man.[531] In other cases, the totem is transmitted from one individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"to another, for example from father to son, or uncle to nephew.[532]",Elementary Forms
41360,"This method is also used in America. In a case reported by Hill Tout,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the operator was a shaman,[533] who wished to transmit his totem to his",Elementary Forms
41360,"nephew. ""The uncle took the symbol of his _snam_ (his personal totem),",Elementary Forms
41360,"which in this case was a dried bird's skin, and bade his nephew breathe",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon it. He then blew upon it also himself, uttered some mystic words",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the dried skin seemed to Paul (the nephew) to become a living bird,",Elementary Forms
41360,which flew about them a moment or two and then finally disappeared.,Elementary Forms
41360,Paul was then instructed by his uncle to procure that day a bird's skin,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the same kind as his uncle's and wear it on his person. This he did,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and that night he had a dream, in which the _snam_ appeared to him in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the shape of a human being, disclosed to him its mystic name by which it",Elementary Forms
41360,"might be summoned, and promised him protection.""[534]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Not only is the individual totem acquired and not given, but ordinarily",Elementary Forms
41360,"the acquisition of one is not obligatory. In the first place, there are",Elementary Forms
41360,a multitude of tribes in Australia where the custom seems to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"absolutely unknown.[535] Also, even where it does exist, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently optional. Thus among the Euahlayi, while all the magicians",Elementary Forms
41360,"have individual totems from which they get their powers, there are a",Elementary Forms
41360,great number of laymen who have none at all. It is a favour given by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"magician, but which he reserves for his friends, his favourites and",Elementary Forms
41360,"those who aspire to becoming his colleagues.[536] Likewise, among",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain Salish, persons desiring to excel especially either in fighting",Elementary Forms
41360,"or in hunting, or aspirants to the position of shaman, are the only ones",Elementary Forms
41360,who provide themselves with protectors of this sort.[537] So among,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain peoples, at least, the individual totem seems to be considered",Elementary Forms
41360,an advantage and convenient thing rather than a necessity. It is a good,Elementary Forms
41360,"thing to have, but a man can do without one. Inversely, a man need not",Elementary Forms
41360,limit himself to a single totem; if he wishes to be more fully,Elementary Forms
41360,"protected, nothing hinders his seeking and acquiring several,[538] and",Elementary Forms
41360,"if the one he has fulfils its part badly, he can change it.[539]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But while it is more optional and free, individual totemism contains",Elementary Forms
41360,within it a force of resistance never attained by the totemism of the,Elementary Forms
41360,clan. One of the chief informers of Hill Tout was a baptized Salish;,Elementary Forms
41360,"however, though he had sincerely abandoned the faith of his fathers, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"though he had become a model catechist, still his faith in the efficacy",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the personal totems remained unshaken.[540] Similarly, though no",Elementary Forms
41360,"visible traces of collective totemism remain in civilized countries, the",Elementary Forms
41360,idea that there is a connection between each individual and some,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal, plant or other object, is at the bottom of many customs still",Elementary Forms
41360,observable in many European countries.[541],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Between collective totemism and individual totemism there is an,Elementary Forms
41360,intermediate form partaking of the characteristics of each: this is,Elementary Forms
41360,sexual totemism. It is found only in Australia and in a small number of,Elementary Forms
41360,tribes. It is mentioned especially in Victoria and New South Wales.[542],Elementary Forms
41360,"Mathews, it is true, claims to have observed it in all the parts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia that he has visited, but he gives no precise facts to support",Elementary Forms
41360,this affirmation.[543],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among these different peoples, all the men of the tribe on the one hand,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and all the women on the other, to whatever special clan they may",Elementary Forms
41360,"belong, form, as it were, two distinct and even antagonistic societies.",Elementary Forms
41360,Now each of these two sexual corporations believes that it is united by,Elementary Forms
41360,"mystical bonds to a determined animal. Among the Kurnai, all the men",Elementary Forms
41360,"think they are brothers, as it were, of the emu-wren (Yeer[)u]ng), all",Elementary Forms
41360,"the women, that they are as sisters of the linnet (Djeetg[)u]n); all the",Elementary Forms
41360,men are Yeer[)u]ng and all the women are Djeetg[)u]n. Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wotjobaluk and the Wurunjerri, it is the bat and the _nightjar_ (a",Elementary Forms
41360,species of screech-owl) respectively who take this role. In other,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribes, the woodpecker is substituted for the _nightjar_. Each sex",Elementary Forms
41360,regards the animal to which it is thus related as a sort of protector,Elementary Forms
41360,which must be treated with the greatest regard; it is also forbidden to,Elementary Forms
41360,kill and eat it.[544],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus this protecting animal plays the same part in relation to the,Elementary Forms
41360,sexual society that the totem of the clan plays to this latter group. So,Elementary Forms
41360,"the expression sexual totemism, which we borrow from Frazer,[545] is",Elementary Forms
41360,justified. This new sort of totem resembles that of the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,"particularly in that it, too, is collective; it belongs to all the",Elementary Forms
41360,people of one sex indiscriminately. It also resembles this form in that,Elementary Forms
41360,it implies a relationship of descent and consanguinity between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal patron and the corresponding sex: among the Kurnai, all the men",Elementary Forms
41360,are believed to be descended from Yeer[)u]ng and all the women from,Elementary Forms
41360,Djeetg[)u]n.[546] The first observer to point out this curious,Elementary Forms
41360,"institution described it, in 1834, in the following terms: ""Tilmun, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"little bird the size of a thrush (it is a sort of woodpecker), is",Elementary Forms
41360,supposed by the women to be the first maker of women. These birds are,Elementary Forms
41360,"held in veneration by the women only.""[547] So it was a great ancestor.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But in other ways, this same totem resembles the individual totem. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, it is believed that each member of a sexual group is personally",Elementary Forms
41360,united to a determined individual of the corresponding animal species.,Elementary Forms
41360,The two lives are so closely associated that the death of the animal,Elementary Forms
41360,"brings about that of the man. ""The life of a bat,"" say the Wotjobaluk,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""is the life of a man.""[548] That is why each sex not only respects its",Elementary Forms
41360,"own totem, but forces the members of the other to do so as well. Every",Elementary Forms
41360,violation of this interdiction gives rise to actual bloody battles,Elementary Forms
41360,between the men and the women.[549],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, the really original feature of these totems is that they are,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a sense, a sort of tribal totems. In fact, they result from men's",Elementary Forms
41360,representing the tribe as descended as a whole from one couple of,Elementary Forms
41360,mythical beings. Such a belief seems to demonstrate clearly that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribal sentiment has acquired sufficient force to resist, at least to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"considerable extent, the particularism of the clans. In regard to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinct origins assigned to men and to women, it must be said that its",Elementary Forms
41360,cause is to be sought in the separate conditions in which the men and,Elementary Forms
41360,the women live.[550],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It would be interesting to know how the sexual totems are related to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totems of the clans, according to the theory of the Australians, what",Elementary Forms
41360,relations there were between the two ancestors thus placed at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"commencement of the tribe, and from which one each special clan is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to be descended. But the ethnographical data at our present,Elementary Forms
41360,"disposal do not allow us to resolve these questions. Moreover, however",Elementary Forms
41360,"natural and even necessary it may appear to us, it is very possible that",Elementary Forms
41360,the natives never raised it. They do not feel the need of co-ordinating,Elementary Forms
41360,and systematizing their beliefs as strongly as we do.[551],Elementary Forms

41360,"of whom we shall have something more to say presently, have, for this",Elementary Forms

41360,"On the other hand, we are assured that this religion is the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive one that is now observable and even, in all probability, that",Elementary Forms

41360,"on a clan basis. Not only is it impossible, as we have already pointed",Elementary Forms

41360,"categories of things, their practising the same rites, or, in a word,",Elementary Forms
41360,from their participating in the same totemic cult. Thus totemism and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clan mutually imply each other, in so far, at least, as the latter is",Elementary Forms
41360,not confounded with the local group. Now the social organization on a,Elementary Forms
41360,"clan basis is the simplest which we know. In fact, it exists in all its",Elementary Forms
41360,essential elements from the moment when the society includes two primary,Elementary Forms
41360,"clans; consequently, we may say that there are none more rudimentary, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"long as societies reduced to a single clan have not been discovered, and",Elementary Forms
41360,we believe that up to the present no traces of such have been found. A,Elementary Forms
41360,religion so closely connected to a social system surpassing all others,Elementary Forms
41360,in simplicity may well be regarded as the most elementary religion we,Elementary Forms
41360,can possibly know. If we succeed in discovering the origins of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs which we have just analysed, we shall very probably discover at",Elementary Forms
41360,the same time the causes leading to the rise of the religious sentiment,Elementary Forms
41360,in humanity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But before treating this question for ourselves, we must examine the",Elementary Forms
41360,most authorized solutions of it which have already been proposed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, we find a group of scholars who believe that they",Elementary Forms
41360,can account for totemism by deriving it from some previous religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"For Tylor[552] and Wilken,[553] totemism is a special form of the cult",Elementary Forms
41360,of the ancestors; it was the widespread doctrine of the transmigration,Elementary Forms
41360,of souls that served as a bridge between these two religious systems. A,Elementary Forms
41360,"large number of peoples believe that after death, the soul does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"remain disincarnate for ever, but presently animates another living",Elementary Forms
41360,"body; on the other hand, ""the lower psychology, drawing no definite line",Elementary Forms
41360,"of demarcation between the souls of men and of beasts, can at least",Elementary Forms
41360,admit without difficulty the transmigration of human souls into the,Elementary Forms
41360,"bodies of the lower animals.""[554] Tylor cites a certain number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"cases.[555] Under these circumstances, the religious respect inspired by",Elementary Forms
41360,the ancestor is quite naturally attached to the animal or plant with,Elementary Forms
41360,which he is presently confounded. The animal thus serving as a,Elementary Forms
41360,"receptacle for a venerated being becomes a holy thing, the object of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"cult, that is, a totem, for all the descendants of the ancestor, who",Elementary Forms
41360,form the clan descended from him.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Facts pointed out by Wilken among the societies of the Malay Archipelago,Elementary Forms
41360,would tend to prove that it really was in this manner that the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs originated. In Java and Sumatra, crocodiles are especially",Elementary Forms
41360,honoured; they are regarded as benevolent protectors who must not be,Elementary Forms
41360,killed; offerings are made to them. Now the cult thus rendered to them,Elementary Forms
41360,is due to their being supposed to incarnate the souls of ancestors. The,Elementary Forms
41360,Malays of the Philippines consider the crocodile their grandfather; the,Elementary Forms
41360,tiger is treated in the same way for the same reasons. Similar beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,have been observed among the Bantous.[556] In Melanesia it sometimes,Elementary Forms
41360,"happens that an influential man, at the moment of death, announces his",Elementary Forms
41360,desire to reincarnate himself in a certain animal or plant; it is easily,Elementary Forms
41360,understood how the object thus chosen as his posthumous residence,Elementary Forms
41360,"becomes sacred for his whole family.[557] So, far from being a primitive",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, totemism would seem to be the product of a more complex religion",Elementary Forms
41360,which preceded it.[558],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the societies from which these facts were taken had already arrived,Elementary Forms
41360,"at a rather advanced stage of culture; in any case, they had passed the",Elementary Forms
41360,stage of pure totemism. They have families and not totemic clans.[559],Elementary Forms
41360,Even the majority of the animals to which religious honours are thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"rendered are venerated, not by special groups of families, but by the",Elementary Forms
41360,tribes as a whole. So if these beliefs and practices do have some,Elementary Forms
41360,"connection with ancient totemic cults, they now represent only altered",Elementary Forms
41360,forms of them[560] and are consequently not very well fitted for showing,Elementary Forms
41360,us their origins. It is not by studying an institution at the moment,Elementary Forms
41360,when it is in full decadence that we can learn how it was formed. If we,Elementary Forms
41360,"want to know how totemism originated, it is neither in Java nor Sumatra",Elementary Forms
41360,"nor Melanesia that we must study it, but in Australia. Here we find",Elementary Forms
41360,neither a cult of the dead[561] nor the doctrine of transmigration. Of,Elementary Forms
41360,"course they believe that the mythical heroes, the founders of the clan,",Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnate themselves periodically; _but this is in human bodies only_;,Elementary Forms
41360,"each birth, as we shall see, is the product of one of these",Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnations. So if the animals of the totemic species are the object,Elementary Forms
41360,"of rites, it is not because the ancestral souls are believed to reside",Elementary Forms
41360,in them. It is true that the first ancestors are frequently represented,Elementary Forms
41360,"under the form of an animal, and this very common representation is an",Elementary Forms
41360,important fact for which we must account; but it was not the belief in,Elementary Forms
41360,"metempsychosis which gave it birth, for this belief is unknown among",Elementary Forms
41360,Australian societies.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, far from being able to explain totemism, this belief takes for",Elementary Forms
41360,granted one of the fundamental principles upon which this rests; that is,Elementary Forms
41360,"to say, it begs the question to be explained. It, just as much as",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism, implies that man is considered a close relative of the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal; for if these two kingdoms were clearly distinguished in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mind, men would never believe that a human soul could pass so easily",Elementary Forms
41360,from one into the other. It is even necessary that the body of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal be considered its true home, for it is believed to go there as",Elementary Forms
41360,soon as it regains its liberty. Now while the doctrine of transmigration,Elementary Forms
41360,"postulates this singular affinity, it offers no explanation of it. The",Elementary Forms
41360,only explanation offered by Tylor is that men sometimes resemble in,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain traits the anatomy and physiology of the animal. ""The half-human",Elementary Forms
41360,features and actions and characters of animals are watched with,Elementary Forms
41360,"wondering sympathy by the savage, as by the child. The beast is the very",Elementary Forms
41360,"incarnation of familiar qualities of man: and such names as lion, bear,",Elementary Forms
41360,"fox, owl, parrot, viper, worm, when we apply them as epithets to men,",Elementary Forms
41360,"condense into a word some leading features of a human life.""[562] But",Elementary Forms
41360,"even if these resemblances are met with, they are uncertain and",Elementary Forms
41360,"exceptional; before all else, men resemble their relatives and",Elementary Forms
41360,"companions, and not plants and animals. Such rare and questionable",Elementary Forms
41360,"analogies could not overcome such unanimous proofs, nor could they lead",Elementary Forms
41360,a man to think of himself and his forefathers in forms contradicted by,Elementary Forms
41360,"daily experience. So this question remains untouched, and as long as it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not answered, we cannot say that totemism is explained.[563]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, this whole theory rests upon a fundamental misunderstanding.",Elementary Forms
41360,"For Tylor as for Wundt, totemism is only a particular case of the cult",Elementary Forms
41360,"of animals.[564] But we, on the contrary, know that it is something",Elementary Forms
41360,very different from a sort of animal-worship.[565] The animal is never,Elementary Forms
41360,adored; the man is nearly its equal and sometimes even treats it as his,Elementary Forms
41360,"possession, so far is he from being subordinate to it like a believer",Elementary Forms
41360,before his god. If the animals of the totemic species are really,Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to incarnate the ancestors, the members of foreign clans would",Elementary Forms
41360,"not be allowed to eat their flesh freely. In reality, it is not to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal as such that the cult is addressed, but to the emblem and the",Elementary Forms
41360,image of the totem. Now between this religion of the emblem and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor-cult, there is no connection whatsoever.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"While Tylor derives totemism from the ancestor-cult, Jevons derives it",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the nature-cult,[566] and here is how he does so.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When, under the impulse of the surprise occasioned by the irregularities",Elementary Forms
41360,"observed in the course of phenomena, men had once peopled the world with",Elementary Forms
41360,"supernatural beings,[567] they felt the need of making agreements with",Elementary Forms
41360,these redoubtable forces with which they had surrounded themselves. They,Elementary Forms
41360,understood that the best way to escape being overwhelmed by them was to,Elementary Forms
41360,"ally themselves to some of them, and thus make sure of their aid. But at",Elementary Forms
41360,this period of history men knew no other form of alliance and,Elementary Forms
41360,association than the one resulting from kinship. All the members of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"single clan aid each other mutually because they are kindred or, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"amounts to the same thing, because they think they are; on the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, different clans treat each other as enemies because they are of",Elementary Forms
41360,different blood. So the only way of assuring themselves of the support,Elementary Forms
41360,of these supernatural beings was to adopt them as kindred and to be,Elementary Forms
41360,adopted by them in the same quality: the well-known processes of the,Elementary Forms
41360,blood-covenant permitted them to attain this result quite easily. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"since at this period, the individual did not yet have a real",Elementary Forms
41360,"personality, and was regarded only as a part of his group, or clan, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"was the clan as a whole, and not the individual, which collectively",Elementary Forms
41360,"contracted this relationship. For the same reason, it was contracted,",Elementary Forms
41360,"not with a particular object, but with the natural group or species of",Elementary Forms
41360,which this object was a part; for men think of the world as they think,Elementary Forms
41360,"of themselves, and just as they could not conceive themselves apart from",Elementary Forms
41360,"their clans, so they were unable to conceive of anything else as",Elementary Forms
41360,distinct from the species to which it belonged. Now a species of things,Elementary Forms
41360,"united to a clan by a bond of kinship is, says Jevons, a totem.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, it is certain that totemism implies the close association of a",Elementary Forms
41360,clan to a determined category of objects. But that this association was,Elementary Forms
41360,contracted with a deliberate design and in the full consciousness of an,Elementary Forms
41360,"end sought after, as Jevons would have us believe, is a statement having",Elementary Forms
41360,"but little harmony with what history teaches. Religions are too complex,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and answer to needs that are too many and too obscure, to have their",Elementary Forms
41360,origin in a premeditated act of the will. And while it sins through,Elementary Forms
41360,"over-simplicity, this hypothesis is also highly improbable. It says that",Elementary Forms
41360,men sought to assure themselves of the aid of the supernatural beings,Elementary Forms
41360,upon which things depend. Then they should preferably have addressed,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves to the most powerful of these, and to those whose protection",Elementary Forms
41360,"promised to be the most beneficial.[568] But quite on the contrary, the",Elementary Forms
41360,beings with whom they have formed this mystic kinship are often among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the most humble which exist. Also, if it were only a question of making",Elementary Forms
41360,"allies and defenders, they would have tried to make as many as possible;",Elementary Forms
41360,"for one cannot be defended too well. Yet as a matter of fact, each clan",Elementary Forms
41360,"systematically contents itself with a single totem, that is to say, with",Elementary Forms
41360,"one single protector, leaving the other clans to enjoy their own in",Elementary Forms
41360,perfect liberty. Each group confines itself within its own religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"domain, never seeking to trespass upon that of its neighbours. This",Elementary Forms
41360,reserve and moderation are inexplicable according to the hypothesis,Elementary Forms
41360,under consideration.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, all these theories are wrong in omitting one question which",Elementary Forms
41360,dominates the whole subject. We have seen that there are two sorts of,Elementary Forms
41360,totemism: that of the individual and that of the clan. There is too,Elementary Forms
41360,evident a kinship between the two for them not to have some connection,Elementary Forms
41360,with each other. So we may well ask if one is not derived from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other, and, in the case of an affirmative answer, which is the more",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive; according to the solution accepted, the problem of the",Elementary Forms
41360,origins of totemism will be posed in different terms. This question,Elementary Forms
41360,becomes all the more necessary because of its general interest.,Elementary Forms
41360,Individual totemism is an individual aspect of the totemic cult. Then if,Elementary Forms
41360,"it was the primitive fact, we must say that religion is born in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness of the individual, that before all else, it answers to",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual aspirations, and that its collective form is merely",Elementary Forms
41360,secondary.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The desire for an undue simplicity, with which ethnologists and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sociologists are too frequently inspired, has naturally led many",Elementary Forms
41360,"scholars to explain, here as elsewhere, the complex by the simple, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem of the group by that of the individual. Such, in fact, is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"theory sustained by Frazer in his _Golden Bough_,[569] by Hill",Elementary Forms
41360,"Tout,[570] by Miss Fletcher,[571] by Boas[572] and by Swanton.[573] It",Elementary Forms
41360,has the additional advantage of being in harmony with the conception of,Elementary Forms
41360,religion which is currently held; this is quite generally regarded as,Elementary Forms
41360,"something intimate and personal. From this point of view, the totem of",Elementary Forms
41360,the clan can only be an individual totem which has become generalized.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Some eminent man, having found from experience the value of a totem he",Elementary Forms
41360,"chose for himself by his own free will, transmitted it to his",Elementary Forms
41360,"descendants; these latter, multiplying as time went on, finally formed",Elementary Forms
41360,"the extended family known as a clan, and thus the totem became",Elementary Forms
41360,collective.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Hill Tout believes that he has found a proof supporting this theory in,Elementary Forms
41360,the way totemism has spread among certain societies of North-western,Elementary Forms
41360,"America, especially among the Salish and certain Indians on the Thompson",Elementary Forms
41360,River. Individual totemism and the clan totemism are both found among,Elementary Forms
41360,"these peoples; but they either do not co-exist in the same tribe, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"else, when they do co-exist, they are not equally developed. They vary",Elementary Forms
41360,in an inverse proportion to each other; where the clan totem tends to,Elementary Forms
41360,"become the general rule, the individual totem tends to disappear, and",Elementary Forms
41360,_vice versa_. Is that not as much as to say that the first is a more,Elementary Forms
41360,"recent form of the second, which excludes it by replacing it?[574]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Mythology seems to confirm this interpretation. In these same societies,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in fact, the ancestor of the clan is not a totemic animal; the founder",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the group is generally represented in the form of a human being who,",Elementary Forms
41360,"at a certain time, had entered into familiar relations with a fabulous",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal from whom he received his totemic emblem. This emblem, together",Elementary Forms
41360,"with the special powers which are attached to it, was then passed on to",Elementary Forms
41360,the descendants of this mythical hero by right of heritage. So these,Elementary Forms
41360,people themselves seem to consider the collective totem as an individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"one, perpetuated in the same family.[575] Moreover, it still happens",Elementary Forms
41360,to-day that a father transmits his own totem to his children. So if we,Elementary Forms
41360,"imagine that the collective totem had, in a general way, this same",Elementary Forms
41360,"origin, we are assuming that the same thing took place in the past which",Elementary Forms
41360,is still observable to-day.[576],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is still to be explained whence the individual totem comes. The reply,Elementary Forms
41360,given to this question varies with different authors.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Hill Tout considers it a particular case of fetishism. Feeling himself,Elementary Forms
41360,"surrounded on all sides by dreaded spirits, the individual experienced",Elementary Forms
41360,that sentiment which we have just seen Jevons attribute to the clan: in,Elementary Forms
41360,"order that he might continue to exist, he sought some powerful protector",Elementary Forms
41360,in this mysterious world. Thus the use of a personal totem became,Elementary Forms
41360,"established.[577] For Frazer, this same institution was rather a",Elementary Forms
41360,"subterfuge or trick of war, invented by men that they might escape from",Elementary Forms
41360,certain dangers. It is known that according to a belief which is very,Elementary Forms
41360,"widespread in a large number of inferior societies, the human soul is",Elementary Forms
41360,"able, without great inconvenience, to quit the body it inhabits for a",Elementary Forms
41360,"while; howsoever far away it may be, it continues to animate this body",Elementary Forms
41360,"by a sort of detached control. Then, in certain critical moments, when",Elementary Forms
41360,"life is supposed to be particularly menaced, it may be desirable to",Elementary Forms
41360,withdraw the soul from the body and lead it to some place or into some,Elementary Forms
41360,"object where it will be in greater security. In fact, there are a",Elementary Forms
41360,certain number of practices whose object is to withdraw the soul in,Elementary Forms
41360,"order to protect it from some danger, either real or imaginary. For",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, at the moment when men are going to enter a newly-built house,",Elementary Forms
41360,"a magician removes their souls and puts them in a sack, to be saved and",Elementary Forms
41360,returned to their proprietors after the door-sill has been crossed. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is because the moment when one enters a new house is exceptionally,Elementary Forms
41360,"critical; one may have disturbed, and consequently offended, the spirits",Elementary Forms
41360,"who reside in the ground and especially under the sill, and if",Elementary Forms
41360,"precautions are not taken, these could make a man pay dearly for his",Elementary Forms
41360,"audacity. But when this danger is once passed, and one has been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,anticipate their anger and even to make sure of their favour through the,Elementary Forms
41360,"accomplishment of certain rites, the souls may safely retake their",Elementary Forms
41360,accustomed place.[578] It is this same belief which gave birth to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"personal totem. To protect themselves from sorcery, men thought it wise",Elementary Forms
41360,to hide their souls in the anonymous crowd of some species of animal or,Elementary Forms
41360,"vegetable. But after these relations had once been established, each",Elementary Forms
41360,individual found himself closely united to the animal or plant where his,Elementary Forms
41360,own vital principle was believed to reside. Two beings so closely united,Elementary Forms
41360,were finally thought to be practically indistinguishable: men believed,Elementary Forms
41360,that each participated in the nature of the other. When this belief had,Elementary Forms
41360,"once been accepted, it facilitated and hastened the transformation of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the personal totem into an hereditary, and consequently a collective,",Elementary Forms
41360,totem; for it seemed quite evident that this kinship of nature should be,Elementary Forms
41360,transmitted hereditarily from father to child.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We shall not stop to discuss these two explanations of the individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem at length: they are ingenious fabrications of the mind, but they",Elementary Forms
41360,completely lack all positive proof. If we are going to reduce totemism,Elementary Forms
41360,"to fetishism, we must first establish that the latter is prior to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"former; now, not merely is no fact brought forward to support this",Elementary Forms
41360,"hypothesis, but it is even contradicted by everything that we know. The",Elementary Forms
41360,ill-determined group of rites going under the name of fetishism seem to,Elementary Forms
41360,appear only among peoples who have already attained to a certain degree,Elementary Forms
41360,of civilization; but it is a species of cult unknown in Australia. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,true that some have described the churinga as a fetish;[579] but even,Elementary Forms
41360,"supposing that this qualification were justified, it would not prove the",Elementary Forms
41360,"priority which is postulated. Quite on the contrary, the churinga",Elementary Forms
41360,"presupposes totemism, since it is essentially an instrument of the",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic cult and owes the virtues attributed to it to totemic beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,alone.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As for the theory of Frazer, it presupposes a thoroughgoing idiocy on",Elementary Forms
41360,the part of the primitive which known facts do not allow us to attribute,Elementary Forms
41360,"to him. He does have a logic, however strange this may at times appear;",Elementary Forms
41360,"now unless he were completely deprived of it, he could never be guilty",Elementary Forms
41360,of the reasoning imputed to him. Nothing could be more natural than that,Elementary Forms
41360,he should believe it possible to assure the survival of his soul by,Elementary Forms
41360,"hiding it in a secret and inaccessible place, as so many heroes of myths",Elementary Forms
41360,and legends are said to have done. But why should he think it safer in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the body of an animal than in his own? Of course, if it were thus lost",Elementary Forms
41360,"in space, it might have a chance to escape the spells of a magician more",Elementary Forms
41360,"readily, but at the same time it would be prepared for the blows of",Elementary Forms
41360,hunters. It is a strange way of sheltering it to place it in a material,Elementary Forms
41360,"form exposing it to risks at every instant.[580] But above all, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,inconceivable that a whole people should allow themselves to be carried,Elementary Forms
41360,"into such an aberration.[581] Finally, in a very large number of cases,",Elementary Forms
41360,the function of the individual totem is very different from that,Elementary Forms
41360,"assigned it by Frazer; before all else, it is a means of conferring",Elementary Forms
41360,"extraordinary powers upon magicians, hunters or warriors.[582] As to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"kinship of the man and the thing, with all the inconveniences it",Elementary Forms
41360,"implies, it is accepted as a consequence of the rite; but it is not",Elementary Forms
41360,desired in its and for itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There is still less occasion for delaying over this controversy since it,Elementary Forms
41360,concerns no real problem. What we must know before everything else is,Elementary Forms
41360,"whether or not the individual totem is really a primitive fact, from",Elementary Forms
41360,"which the collective totem was derived; for, according to the reply",Elementary Forms
41360,"given to this question, we must seek the home of the religious life in",Elementary Forms
41360,one or the other of two opposite directions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Against the hypothesis of Hill Tout, Miss Fletcher, Boas and Frazer",Elementary Forms
41360,there is such an array of decisive facts that one is surprised that it,Elementary Forms
41360,has been so readily and so generally accepted.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, we know that a man frequently has the greatest",Elementary Forms
41360,"interest not only in respecting, but also in making his companions",Elementary Forms
41360,respect the species serving him as personal totem; his own life is,Elementary Forms
41360,connected with it. Then if collective totemism were only a generalized,Elementary Forms
41360,"form of individual totemism, it too should repose upon this same",Elementary Forms
41360,principle. Not only should the men of a clan abstain from killing and,Elementary Forms
41360,"eating their totem-animal themselves, but they should also do all in",Elementary Forms
41360,their power to force this same abstention upon others. But as a matter,Elementary Forms
41360,"of fact, far from imposing such a renunciation upon the whole tribe,",Elementary Forms
41360,"each clan, by rites which we shall describe below, takes care that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"plant or animal whose name it bears shall increase and prosper, so as",Elementary Forms
41360,to assure an abundant supply of food for the other clans. So we must at,Elementary Forms
41360,"least admit that in becoming collective, individual totemism was",Elementary Forms
41360,"transformed profoundly, and we must therefore account for this",Elementary Forms
41360,transformation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the second place, how is it possible to explain, from this point of",Elementary Forms
41360,"view, the fact that except where totemism is in full decay, two clans of",Elementary Forms
41360,a single tribe always have different totems? It seems that nothing,Elementary Forms
41360,"prevents two or several members of a single tribe, even when there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,"kinship between them, from choosing their personal totem in the same",Elementary Forms
41360,animal species and passing it on to their descendants. Does it not,Elementary Forms
41360,happen to-day that two distinct families have the same name? The,Elementary Forms
41360,carefully regulated way in which the totems and sub-totems are divided,Elementary Forms
41360,"up, first between the two phratries and then among the various clans of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the phratry, obviously presupposes a social agreement and a collective",Elementary Forms
41360,organization. This is as much as to say that totemism is something more,Elementary Forms
41360,than an individual practice spontaneously generalized.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, collective totemism cannot be deduced from individual totemism",Elementary Forms
41360,except by a misunderstanding of the differences separating the two. The,Elementary Forms
41360,one is acquired by the child at birth; it is a part of his civil status.,Elementary Forms
41360,The other is acquired during the course of his life; it presupposes the,Elementary Forms
41360,accomplishment of a determined rite and a change of condition. Some seek,Elementary Forms
41360,"to diminish this distance by inserting between the two, as a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,"middle term, the right of each possessor of a totem to transmit it to",Elementary Forms
41360,"whomsoever he pleases. But wherever these transfers do take place, they",Elementary Forms
41360,are rare and relatively exceptional acts; they cannot be performed,Elementary Forms
41360,except by magicians or other personages invested with special,Elementary Forms
41360,"powers;[583] in any case, they are possible only through ritual",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies which bring about the change. So it is necessary to explain,Elementary Forms
41360,how this prerogative of a few became the right of all; how that which at,Elementary Forms
41360,first implied a profound change in the religious and moral constitution,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the individual, was able to become an element of this constitution;",Elementary Forms
41360,"and finally, how a transmission which at first was the consequence of a",Elementary Forms
41360,rite was later believed to operate automatically from the nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,things and without the intervention of any human will.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In support of his interpretation, Hill Tout claims that certain myths",Elementary Forms
41360,give the totem of the clan an individual origin: they tell how the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic emblem was acquired by some special individual, who then",Elementary Forms
41360,"transmitted it to his descendants. But in the first place, it is to be",Elementary Forms
41360,remarked that these myths are all taken from the Indian tribes of North,Elementary Forms
41360,"America, which are societies arrived at a rather high degree of culture.",Elementary Forms
41360,How could a mythology so far removed from the origins of things aid in,Elementary Forms
41360,reconstituting the primitive form of an institution with any degree of,Elementary Forms
41360,certainty? There are many chances for intermediate causes to have,Elementary Forms
41360,gravely disfigured the recollection which these people have been able to,Elementary Forms
41360,"retain. Moreover, it is very easy to answer these myths with others,",Elementary Forms
41360,which seem much more primitive and whose signification is quite,Elementary Forms
41360,different. The totem is there represented as the very being from whom,Elementary Forms
41360,the clan is descended. So it must be that it constitutes the substance,Elementary Forms
41360,of the clan; men have it within them from their birth; it is a part of,Elementary Forms
41360,"their very flesh and blood, so far are they from having received it from",Elementary Forms
41360,"without.[584] More than that, the very myths upon which Hill Tout relies",Elementary Forms
41360,contain an echo of this ancient conception. The founder who gave his,Elementary Forms
41360,"name to the clan certainly had a human form; but he was a man who, after",Elementary Forms
41360,"living among animals of a certain species, finally came to resemble",Elementary Forms
41360,them. This is undoubtedly because a time came when the mind was too,Elementary Forms
41360,"cultivated to admit any longer, as it had formerly done, that men might",Elementary Forms
41360,"have been born of animals; so the animal ancestor, now become",Elementary Forms
41360,"inconceivable, is replaced by a human being; but the idea persists that",Elementary Forms
41360,this man had acquired certain characteristics of the animal either by,Elementary Forms
41360,imitation or by some other process. Thus even this late mythology bears,Elementary Forms
41360,the mark of a more remote epoch when the totem of the clan was never,Elementary Forms
41360,regarded as a sort of individual creation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this hypothesis does not merely raise grave logical difficulties; it,Elementary Forms
41360,is contradicted directly by the following facts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If individual totemism were the initial fact, it should be more",Elementary Forms
41360,"developed and apparent, the more primitive the societies are, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"inversely, it should lose ground and disappear before the other among",Elementary Forms
41360,the more advanced peoples. Now it is the contrary which is true. The,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian tribes are far behind those of North America; yet Australia,Elementary Forms
41360,is the classic land of collective totemism. _In the great majority of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the tribes, it alone is found, while we do not know a single one where",Elementary Forms
41360,individual totemism alone is practised._[585] This latter is found in a,Elementary Forms
41360,characteristic form only in an infinitesimal number of tribes.[586] Even,Elementary Forms
41360,where it is met with it is generally in a rudimentary form. It is made,Elementary Forms
41360,up of individual and optional practices having no generality. Only,Elementary Forms
41360,magicians are acquainted with the art of creating mysterious,Elementary Forms
41360,relationships with species of animals to which they are not related by,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. Ordinary people do not enjoy this privilege.[587] In America, on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, the collective totem is in full decadence; in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"societies of the North-west especially, its religious character is",Elementary Forms
41360,"almost gone. Inversely, the individual totem plays a considerable role",Elementary Forms
41360,among these same peoples. A very great efficacy is attributed to it; it,Elementary Forms
41360,has become a real public institution. This is because it is the sign of,Elementary Forms
41360,a higher civilization. This is undoubtedly the explanation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"inversion of these two forms of totemism, which Hill Tout believes he",Elementary Forms
41360,has observed among the Salish. If in those parts where collective,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism is the most fully developed the other form is almost lacking,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is not because the second has disappeared before the first, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"rather, because the conditions necessary for its existence have not yet",Elementary Forms
41360,been fully realized.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But a fact which is still more conclusive is that individual totemism,",Elementary Forms
41360,"far from having given birth to the totemism of the clan, presupposes",Elementary Forms
41360,this latter. It is within the frame of collective totemism that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"born and lives: it is an integral part of it. In fact, in those very",Elementary Forms
41360,"societies where it is preponderating, the novices do not have the right",Elementary Forms
41360,of taking any animal as their individual totem; to each clan a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"definite number of species are assigned, outside of which it may not",Elementary Forms
41360,"choose. In return, those belonging to it thus are its exclusive",Elementary Forms
41360,property; members of other clans may not usurp them.[588] They are,Elementary Forms
41360,thought to have relations of close dependence upon the one serving as,Elementary Forms
41360,totem to the clan as a whole. There are even cases where it is quite,Elementary Forms
41360,possible to observe these relations: the individual aspect represents a,Elementary Forms
41360,part or a particular aspect of the collective totem.[589] Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wotjobaluk, each member of the clan considers the personal totems of",Elementary Forms
41360,his companions as being his own after a fashion;[590] so they are,Elementary Forms
41360,"probably sub-totems. Now the sub-totem supposes the totem, as the",Elementary Forms
41360,species supposes the class. Thus the first form of individual religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"met with in history appears, not as the active principle of all public",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, but, on the contrary, as a simple aspect of this latter. The",Elementary Forms
41360,cult which the individual organizes for himself in his own inner,Elementary Forms
41360,"conscience, far from being the germ of the collective cult, is only this",Elementary Forms
41360,latter adapted to the personal needs of the individual.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a more recent study,[591] which the works of Spencer and Gillen",Elementary Forms
41360,"suggested to him, Frazer has attempted to substitute a new explanation",Elementary Forms
41360,"of totemism for the one he first proposed, and which we have just been",Elementary Forms
41360,discussing. It rests on the postulate that the totemism of the Arunta is,Elementary Forms
41360,the most primitive which we know; Frazer even goes so far as to say that,Elementary Forms
41360,it scarcely differs from the really and absolutely original type.[592],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The singular thing about it is that the totems are attached neither to,Elementary Forms
41360,"persons nor to determined groups of persons, but to localities. In fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,each totem has its centre at some definite spot. It is there that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"souls of the first ancestors, who founded the totemic group at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"beginning of time, are believed to have their preferred residence. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,there that the sanctuary is located where the churinga are kept; there,Elementary Forms
41360,the cult is celebrated. It is also this geographical distribution of,Elementary Forms
41360,totems which determines the manner in which the clans are recruited. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"child has neither the totem of his father nor that of his mother, but",Elementary Forms
41360,the one whose centre is at the spot where the mother believes that she,Elementary Forms
41360,felt the first symptoms of approaching maternity. For it is said that,Elementary Forms
41360,the Arunta is ignorant of the exact relation existing between generation,Elementary Forms
41360,and the sexual act;[593] he thinks that every conception is due to a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of mystic fecundation. According to him, it is due to the entrance",Elementary Forms
41360,of the soul of an ancestor into the body of a woman and its becoming the,Elementary Forms
41360,principle of a new life there. So at the moment when a woman feels the,Elementary Forms
41360,"first tremblings of the child, she imagines that one of the souls whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"principal residence is at the place where she happens to be, has just",Elementary Forms
41360,entered into her. As the child who is presently born is merely the,Elementary Forms
41360,"reincarnation of this ancestor, he necessarily has the same totem; thus",Elementary Forms
41360,his totem is determined by the locality where he is believed to have,Elementary Forms
41360,been mysteriously conceived.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now, it is this local totemism which represents the original form of",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism; at most, it is separated from this by a very short step. This",Elementary Forms
41360,is how Frazer explains its genesis.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"At the exact moment when the woman realizes that she is pregnant, she",Elementary Forms
41360,must think that the spirit by which she feels herself possessed has come,Elementary Forms
41360,"to her from the objects about her, and especially from one of those",Elementary Forms
41360,which attract her attention at the moment. So if she is engaged in,Elementary Forms
41360,"plucking a plant, or watching an animal, she believes that the soul of",Elementary Forms
41360,this plant or animal has passed into her. Among the things to which she,Elementary Forms
41360,"will be particularly inclined to attribute her condition are, in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first place, the things she has just eaten. If she has recently eaten",Elementary Forms
41360,"emu or yam, she will not doubt that an emu or yam has been born in her",Elementary Forms
41360,"and is developing. Under these conditions, it is evident how the child,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in his turn, will be considered a sort of yam or emu, how he regards",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself as a relative of the plant or animal of the same species, how he",Elementary Forms
41360,"has sympathy and regard for them, how he refuses to eat them, etc.[594]",Elementary Forms
41360,"From this moment, totemism exists in its essential traits: it is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"native's theory of conception that gave rise to it, so Frazer calls this",Elementary Forms
41360,primitive totemism _conceptional_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is from this original type that all the other forms of totemism are,Elementary Forms
41360,"derived. ""When several women had, one after the other, felt the first",Elementary Forms
41360,premonitions of maternity at the same spot and under the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances, the place would come to be regarded as haunted by spirits",Elementary Forms
41360,of a peculiar sort; and so the whole country might in time be dotted,Elementary Forms
41360,"over with totem centres and distributed into totem districts.""[595] This",Elementary Forms
41360,is how the local totemism of the Arunta originated. In order that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totems may subsequently be detached from their territorial base, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"sufficient to think that the ancestral souls, instead of remaining",Elementary Forms
41360,"immutably fixed to a determined spot, are able to move freely over the",Elementary Forms
41360,surface of the territory and that in their voyages they follow the men,Elementary Forms
41360,"and women of the same totem as themselves. In this way, a woman may be",Elementary Forms
41360,"impregnated by her own totem or that of her husband, though residing in",Elementary Forms
41360,a different totemic district. According to whether it is believed that,Elementary Forms
41360,it is the ancestor of the husband or of the wife who thus follow the,Elementary Forms
41360,"family about, seeking occasions to reincarnate themselves, the totem of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the child will be that of his father or mother. In fact, it is in just",Elementary Forms
41360,"this way that the Guanji and Umbaia on the one hand, and the Urabunna on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the other, explain their systems of filiation.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But this theory, like that of Tylor, rests upon a begging of the",Elementary Forms
41360,question. If he is to imagine that human souls are the souls of animals,Elementary Forms
41360,"or plants, one must believe beforehand that men take either from the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal or vegetable world whatever is most essential in them. Now this,Elementary Forms
41360,belief is one of those at the foundation of totemism. To state it as,Elementary Forms
41360,something evident is therefore to take for granted that which is to be,Elementary Forms
41360,explained.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, from this point of view, the religious character of the totem",Elementary Forms
41360,"is entirely inexplicable, for the vague belief in an obscure kinship",Elementary Forms
41360,between the man and the animal is not enough to found a cult. This,Elementary Forms
41360,confusion of distinct kingdoms could never result in dividing the world,Elementary Forms
41360,"into sacred and profane. It is true that, being consistent with himself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Frazer refuses to admit that totemism is a religion, under the pretext",Elementary Forms
41360,"that he finds in it neither spiritual beings, nor prayers, nor",Elementary Forms
41360,"invocations, nor offerings, etc. According to him, it is only a system",Elementary Forms
41360,"of magic, by which he means a sort of crude and erroneous science, a",Elementary Forms
41360,first effort to discover the laws of things.[596] But we know how,Elementary Forms
41360,"inexact this conception, both of magic and of religion, is. We have a",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion as soon as the sacred is distinguished from the profane, and we",Elementary Forms
41360,have seen that totemism is a vast system of sacred things. If we are to,Elementary Forms
41360,"explain it, we must therefore show how it happened that these things",Elementary Forms
41360,were stamped with this character.[597] But he does not even raise this,Elementary Forms
41360,problem.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this system is completely overthrown by the fact that the postulate,Elementary Forms
41360,upon which it rests can no longer be sustained. The whole argument of,Elementary Forms
41360,Frazer supposes that the local totemism of the Arunta is the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive we know, and especially that it is clearly prior to",Elementary Forms
41360,"hereditary totemism, either in the paternal or the maternal line. Now as",Elementary Forms
41360,soon as the facts contained in the first volume of Spencer and Gillen,Elementary Forms
41360,"were at our disposal, we were able to conjecture that there had been a",Elementary Forms
41360,"time in the history of the Arunta people when the totems, instead of",Elementary Forms
41360,"being attached to localities, were transmitted hereditarily from mother",Elementary Forms
41360,to child.[598] This conjecture is definitely proved by the new facts,Elementary Forms
41360,"discovered by Strehlow,[599] which only confirm the previous",Elementary Forms
41360,"observations of Schulze.[600] In fact, both of these authors tell us",Elementary Forms
41360,"that even now, in addition to his local totem, each Arunta has another",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is completely independent of all geographical conditions, and",Elementary Forms
41360,which belongs to him as a birthright: it is his mother's. This second,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem, just like the first, is considered a powerful friend and",Elementary Forms
41360,"protector by the natives, which looks after their food, warns them of",Elementary Forms
41360,"possible dangers, etc. They have the right of taking part in its cult.",Elementary Forms
41360,"When they are buried, the corpse is laid so that the face is turned",Elementary Forms
41360,towards the region of the maternal totemic centre. So after a fashion,Elementary Forms
41360,this centre is also that of the deceased. In fact it is given the name,Elementary Forms
41360,"_tmara altjira_, which is translated: camp of the totem which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"associated with me. So it is certain that among the Arunta, hereditary",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism in the uterine line is not later than local totemism, but, on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, must have preceded it. For to-day, the maternal totem has",Elementary Forms
41360,"only an accessory and supplementary role; it is a second totem, which",Elementary Forms
41360,explains how it was able to escape observation as attentive and careful,Elementary Forms
41360,as that of Spencer and Gillen. But in order that it should be able to,Elementary Forms
41360,"retain this secondary place, being employed along with the local totem,",Elementary Forms
41360,there must have been a time when it held the primary place in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious life. It is, in part, a fallen totem, but one recalling an",Elementary Forms
41360,epoch when the totemic organization of the Arunta was very different,Elementary Forms
41360,from what it is to-day. So the whole superstructure of Frazer's system,Elementary Forms
41360,is undermined at its foundation.[601],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Although Andrew Lang has actively contested this theory of Frazer's, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"one he proposes himself in his later works,[602] resembles it on more",Elementary Forms
41360,"than one point. Like Frazer, he makes totemism consist in the belief in",Elementary Forms
41360,a sort of consubstantiality of the man and the animal. But he explains,Elementary Forms
41360,it differently.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,He derives it entirely from the fact that the totem is a name. As soon,Elementary Forms
41360,"as human groups were founded,[603] each one felt the need of",Elementary Forms
41360,distinguishing between the neighbouring groups with which it came into,Elementary Forms
41360,"contact and, with this end in view, it gave them different names. The",Elementary Forms
41360,names were preferably chosen from the surrounding flora and fauna,Elementary Forms
41360,because animals and plants can easily be designated by movements or,Elementary Forms
41360,represented by drawings.[604] The more or less precise resemblances,Elementary Forms
41360,which men may have with such and such objects determined the way in,Elementary Forms
41360,which these collective denominations were distributed among the,Elementary Forms
41360,groups.[605],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now, it is a well-known fact that ""to the early mind names, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"things known by names, are in a mystic and transcendental connection of",Elementary Forms
41360,"_rapport_.""[606] For example, the name of an individual is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"considered as a simple word or conventional sign, but as an essential",Elementary Forms
41360,"part of the individual himself. So if it were the name of an animal, the",Elementary Forms
41360,man would have to believe that he himself had the most characteristic,Elementary Forms
41360,attributes of this same animal. This theory would become better and,Elementary Forms
41360,better accredited as the historic origins of these denominations became,Elementary Forms
41360,more remote and were effaced from the memory. Myths arose to make this,Elementary Forms
41360,strange ambiguity of human nature more easily representable in the mind.,Elementary Forms
41360,"To explain this, they imagined that the animal was the ancestor of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"men, or else that the two were descended from a common ancestor. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,came the conception of bonds of kinship uniting each clan to the animal,Elementary Forms
41360,species whose name it bore. With the origins of this fabulous kinship,Elementary Forms
41360,"once explained, it seems to our author that totemism no longer contains",Elementary Forms
41360,a mystery.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But whence comes the religious character of the totemic beliefs and,Elementary Forms
41360,practices? For the fact that a man considers himself an animal of a,Elementary Forms
41360,certain species does not explain why he attributes marvellous powers to,Elementary Forms
41360,"this species, and especially why he renders a cult to the images",Elementary Forms
41360,symbolizing it.--To this question Lang gives the same response as,Elementary Forms
41360,"Frazer: he denies that totemism is a religion. ""I find in Australia,"" he",Elementary Forms
41360,"says, ""no example of religious practices such as praying to, nourishing",Elementary Forms
41360,"or burying the totem.""[607] It was only at a later epoch, when it was",Elementary Forms
41360,"already established, that totemism was drawn into and surrounded by a",Elementary Forms
41360,system of conceptions properly called religious. According to a remark,Elementary Forms
41360,"of Howitt,[608] when the natives undertake the explanation of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic institutions, they do not attribute them to the totems",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves nor to a man, but to some supernatural being such as Bunjil",Elementary Forms
41360,"or Baiame. ""Accepting this evidence,"" says Lang, ""one source of the",Elementary Forms
41360,'religious' character of totemism is at once revealed. The totemist,Elementary Forms
41360,"obeys the decree of Bunjil, or Baiame, as the Cretans obeyed the divine",Elementary Forms
41360,"decrees given by Zeus to Minos."" Now according to Lang the idea of these",Elementary Forms
41360,great divinities arose outside of the totemic system; so this is not a,Elementary Forms
41360,religion in itself; it has merely been given a religious colouring by,Elementary Forms
41360,contact with a genuine religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But these very myths contradict Lang's conception of totemism. If the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australians had regarded totemism as something human and profane, it",Elementary Forms
41360,would never have occurred to them to make a divine institution out of,Elementary Forms
41360,"it. If, on the other hand, they have felt the need of connecting it with",Elementary Forms
41360,"a divinity, it is because they have seen a sacred character in it. So",Elementary Forms
41360,these mythological interpretations prove the religious nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism, but do not explain it.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, Lang himself recognizes that this solution is not sufficient.",Elementary Forms
41360,He realizes that totemic things are treated with a religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"respect;[609] that especially the blood of an animal, as well as that of",Elementary Forms
41360,"a man, is the object of numerous interdictions, or, as he says, taboos",Elementary Forms
41360,which this comparatively late mythology cannot explain.[610] Then where,Elementary Forms
41360,do they come from? Here are the words with which Lang answers this,Elementary Forms
41360,"question: ""As soon as the animal-named groups evolved the universally",Elementary Forms
41360,"diffused beliefs about the _wakan_ or _mana_, or mystically sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"quality of the blood as the life, they would also develop the various",Elementary Forms
41360,"taboos.""[611] The words _wakan_ and _mana_, as we shall see in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"following chapter, involve the very idea of _sacredness_ itself; the one",Elementary Forms
41360,"is taken from the language of the Sioux, the other from that of the",Elementary Forms
41360,Melanesian peoples. To explain the sacred character of totemic things by,Elementary Forms
41360,"postulating this characteristic, is to answer the question by the",Elementary Forms
41360,question. What we must find out is whence this idea of _wakan_ comes and,Elementary Forms
41360,how it comes to be applied to the totem and all that is derived from it.,Elementary Forms
41360,"As long as these two questions remain unanswered, nothing is explained.",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have now passed in review all the principal explanations which have,Elementary Forms
41360,"been given for totemic beliefs,[612] leaving to each of them its own",Elementary Forms
41360,"individuality. But now that this examination is finished, we may state",Elementary Forms
41360,one criticism which addresses itself to all these systems alike.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If we stick to the letter of the formulae, it seems that these may be",Elementary Forms
41360,"arranged in two groups. Some (Frazer, Lang) deny the religious character",Elementary Forms
41360,"of totemism; in reality, that amounts to denying the facts. Others",Elementary Forms
41360,"recognize this, but think that they can explain it by deriving it from",Elementary Forms
41360,an anterior religion out of which totemism developed. But as a matter of,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, this distinction is only apparent: the first group is contained",Elementary Forms
41360,within the second. Neither Frazer nor Lang have been able to maintain,Elementary Forms
41360,their principle systematically and explain totemism as if it were not a,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion. By the very force of facts, they have been compelled to slip",Elementary Forms
41360,ideas of a religious nature into their explanations. We have just seen,Elementary Forms
41360,"how Lang calls in the idea of sacredness, which is the cardinal idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,"all religion. Frazer, on his side, in each of the theories which he has",Elementary Forms
41360,"successively proposed, appeals openly to the idea of souls or spirits;",Elementary Forms
41360,"for according to him, totemism came from the fact that men thought they",Elementary Forms
41360,"could deposit their souls in safety in some external object, or else",Elementary Forms
41360,that they attributed conception to a sort of spiritual fecundation of,Elementary Forms
41360,"which a spirit was the agent. Now a soul, and still more, a spirit, are",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred things and the object of rites; so the ideas expressing them are,Elementary Forms
41360,essentially religious and it is therefore in vain that Frazer makes,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism a mere system of magic, for he succeeds in explaining it only",Elementary Forms
41360,in the terms of another religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have already pointed out the insufficiencies of animism and naturism;,Elementary Forms
41360,"so one may not have recourse to them, as Tylor and Jevons do, without",Elementary Forms
41360,exposing himself to these same objections. Yet neither Frazer nor Lang,Elementary Forms
41360,seems to dream of the possibility of another hypothesis.[613] On the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, we know that totemism is tightly bound up with the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive social system which we know, and in all probability, of which",Elementary Forms
41360,we can conceive. To suppose that it has developed out of another,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, differing from it only in degree, is to leave the data of",Elementary Forms
41360,observation and enter into the domain of arbitrary and unverifiable,Elementary Forms
41360,conjectures. If we wish to remain in harmony with the results we have,Elementary Forms
41360,"already obtained, it is necessary that while affirming the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of totemism, we abstain from deriving it from another different",Elementary Forms
41360,religion. There can be no hope of assigning it non-religious ideas as,Elementary Forms
41360,its cause. But among the representations entering into the conditions,Elementary Forms
41360,"from which it results, there may be some which directly suggest a",Elementary Forms
41360,religious nature of themselves. These are the ones we must look for.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Since individual totemism is later than the totemism of the clan, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"even seems to be derived from it, it is to this latter form that we must",Elementary Forms
41360,turn first of all. But as the analysis which we have just made of it has,Elementary Forms
41360,resolved it into a multiplicity of beliefs which may appear quite,Elementary Forms
41360,"heterogeneous, before going farther, we must seek to learn what makes",Elementary Forms
41360,its unity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have seen that totemism places the figured representations of the,Elementary Forms
41360,totem in the first rank of the things it considers sacred; next come the,Elementary Forms
41360,"animals or vegetables whose name the clan bears, and finally the members",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the clan. Since all these things are sacred in the same way, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"to different degrees, their religious character can be due to none of",Elementary Forms
41360,the special attributes distinguishing them from each other. If a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"species of animal or vegetable is the object of a reverential fear, this",Elementary Forms
41360,"is not because of its special properties, for the human members of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clan enjoy this same privilege, though to a slightly inferior degree,",Elementary Forms
41360,while the mere image of this same plant or animal inspires an even more,Elementary Forms
41360,pronounced respect. The similar sentiments inspired by these different,Elementary Forms
41360,"sorts of things in the mind of the believer, which give them their",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character, can evidently come only from some common principle",Elementary Forms
41360,"partaken of alike by the totemic emblems, the men of the clan and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individuals of the species serving as totem. In reality, it is to this",Elementary Forms
41360,common principle that the cult is addressed. In other words totemism is,Elementary Forms
41360,"the religion, not of such and such animals or men or images, but of an",Elementary Forms
41360,"anonymous and impersonal force, found in each of these beings but not to",Elementary Forms
41360,be confounded with any of them. No one possesses it entirely and all,Elementary Forms
41360,participate in it. It is so completely independent of the particular,Elementary Forms
41360,"subjects in whom it incarnates itself, that it precedes them and",Elementary Forms
41360,"survives them. Individuals die, generations pass and are replaced by",Elementary Forms
41360,"others; but this force always remains actual, living and the same. It",Elementary Forms
41360,animates the generations of to-day as it animated those of yesterday and,Elementary Forms
41360,as it will animate those of to-morrow. Taking the words in a large,Elementary Forms
41360,"sense, we may say that it is the god adored by each totemic cult. Yet it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is an impersonal god, without name or history, immanent in the world and",Elementary Forms
41360,diffused in an innumerable multitude of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But even now we have only an imperfect idea of the real ubiquity of this,Elementary Forms
41360,quasi-divine entity. It is not merely found in the whole totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"species, the whole clan and all the objects symbolizing the totem: the",Elementary Forms
41360,"circle of its action extends beyond that. In fact, we have seen that in",Elementary Forms
41360,"addition to the eminently holy things, all those attributed to the clan",Elementary Forms
41360,as dependencies of the principal totem have this same character to a,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain degree. They also have something religious about them, for some",Elementary Forms
41360,"are protected by interdictions, while others have determined functions",Elementary Forms
41360,in the ceremonies of the cult. Their religiousness does not differ in,Elementary Forms
41360,kind from that of the totem under which they are classified; it must,Elementary Forms
41360,therefore be derived from the same source. So it is because the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,god--to use again the metaphorical expression which we have just,Elementary Forms
41360,"employed--is in them, just as it is in the species serving as totem and",Elementary Forms
41360,in the men of the clan. We may see how much it differs from the beings,Elementary Forms
41360,in which it resides from the fact that it is the soul of so many,Elementary Forms
41360,different beings.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the Australian does not represent this impersonal force in an,Elementary Forms
41360,"abstract form. Under the influence of causes which we must seek, he has",Elementary Forms
41360,been led to conceive it under the form of an animal or vegetable,Elementary Forms
41360,"species, or, in a word, of a visible object This is what the totem",Elementary Forms
41360,really consists in: it is only the material form under which the,Elementary Forms
41360,"imagination represents this immaterial substance, this energy diffused",Elementary Forms
41360,"through all sorts of heterogeneous things, which alone is the real",Elementary Forms
41360,object of the cult. We are now in a better condition for understanding,Elementary Forms
41360,"what the native means when he says that the men of the Crow phratry, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, are crows. He does not exactly mean to say that they are crows",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the vulgar and empiric sense of the term, but that the same principle",Elementary Forms
41360,"is found in all of them, which is their most essential characteristic,",Elementary Forms
41360,which they have in common with the animals of the same name and which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought of under the external form of a crow. Thus the universe, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemism conceives it, is filled and animated by a certain number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces which the imagination represents in forms taken, with only a few",Elementary Forms
41360,"exceptions, from the animal or vegetable kingdoms: there are as many of",Elementary Forms
41360,"them as there are clans in the tribe, and each of them is also found in",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain categories of things, of which it is the essence and vital",Elementary Forms
41360,principle.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When we say that these principles are forces, we do not take the word in",Elementary Forms
41360,"a metaphorical sense; they act just like veritable forces. In one sense,",Elementary Forms
41360,they are even material forces which mechanically engender physical,Elementary Forms
41360,effects. Does an individual come in contact with them without having,Elementary Forms
41360,taken proper precautions? He receives a shock which might be compared to,Elementary Forms
41360,the effect of an electric discharge. Sometimes they seem to conceive of,Elementary Forms
41360,these as a sort of fluid escaping by points.[614] If they are introduced,Elementary Forms
41360,"into an organism not made to receive them, they produce sickness and",Elementary Forms
41360,"death by a wholly automatic action.[615] Outside of men, they play the",Elementary Forms
41360,"role of vital principle; it is by acting on them, we shall see,[616]",Elementary Forms
41360,that the reproduction of the species is assured. It is upon them that,Elementary Forms
41360,the universal life reposes.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But in addition to this physical aspect, they also have a moral",Elementary Forms
41360,"character. When someone asks a native why he observes his rites, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"replies that his ancestors always have observed them, and he ought to",Elementary Forms
41360,follow their example.[617] So if he acts in a certain way towards the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic beings, it is not only because the forces resident in them are",Elementary Forms
41360,"physically redoubtable, but because he feels himself morally obliged to",Elementary Forms
41360,"act thus; he has the feeling that he is obeying an imperative, that he",Elementary Forms
41360,"is fulfilling a duty. For these sacred beings, he has not merely fear,",Elementary Forms
41360,"but also respect. Moreover, the totem is the source of the moral life of",Elementary Forms
41360,the clan. All the beings partaking of the same totemic principle,Elementary Forms
41360,"consider that owing to this very fact, they are morally bound to one",Elementary Forms
41360,"another; they have definite duties of assistance, vendetta, etc.,",Elementary Forms
41360,towards each other; and it is these duties which constitute kinship. So,Elementary Forms
41360,"while the totemic principle is a totemic force, it is also a moral",Elementary Forms
41360,power; so we shall see how it easily transforms itself into a divinity,Elementary Forms
41360,properly so-called.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, there is nothing here which is special to totemism. Even in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the most advanced religions, there is scarcely a god who has not kept",Elementary Forms
41360,something of this ambiguity and whose functions are not at once cosmic,Elementary Forms
41360,"and moral. At the same time that it is a spiritual discipline, every",Elementary Forms
41360,religion is also a means enabling men to face the world with greater,Elementary Forms
41360,"confidence. Even for the Christian, is not God the Father the guardian",Elementary Forms
41360,of the physical order as well as the legislator and the judge of human,Elementary Forms
41360,conduct?,Elementary Forms

41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Perhaps someone will ask whether, in interpreting totemism thus, we do",Elementary Forms
41360,not endow the native with ideas surpassing the limits of his intellect.,Elementary Forms
41360,Of course we are not prepared to affirm that he represents these forces,Elementary Forms
41360,with the relative clarity which we have been able to give to them in our,Elementary Forms
41360,analysis. We are able to show quite clearly that this notion is implied,Elementary Forms
41360,by the whole system of beliefs which it dominates; but we are unable to,Elementary Forms
41360,"say how far it is conscious and how far, on the contrary, it is only",Elementary Forms
41360,implicit and confusedly felt. There is no way of determining just what,Elementary Forms
41360,degree of clarity an idea like this may have in obscure minds. But it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"well shown, in any case, that this in no way surpasses the capacities of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the primitive mind, and on the contrary, the results at which we have",Elementary Forms
41360,just arrived are confirmed by the fact that either in the societies,Elementary Forms
41360,"closely related to these Australian tribes, or even in these tribes",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves, we find, in an explicit form, conceptions which differ from",Elementary Forms
41360,the preceding only by shades and degrees.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The native religions of Samoa have certainly passed the totemic phase.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Real gods are found there, who have their own names, and, to a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"degree, their own personal physiognomy. Yet the traces of totemism are",Elementary Forms
41360,"hardly contestable. In fact, each god is attached to a group, either",Elementary Forms
41360,"local or domestic, just as the totem is to its clan.[618] Then, each of",Elementary Forms
41360,these gods is thought of as immanent in a special species of animal. But,Elementary Forms
41360,this does not mean that he resides in one subject in particular: he is,Elementary Forms
41360,immanent in all at once; he is diffused in the species as a whole. When,Elementary Forms
41360,"an animal dies, the men of the group who venerate it weep for it and",Elementary Forms
41360,"render pious duties to it, because a god inhabits it; but the god is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"dead. He is eternal, like the species. He is not even confused with the",Elementary Forms
41360,"present generation; he has already been the soul of the preceding one,",Elementary Forms
41360,as he will be the soul of the one which is to follow.[619] So he has all,Elementary Forms
41360,the characteristics of the totemic principle. He is the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle, re-clothed in a slightly personal form by the imagination.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But still, we must not exaggerate a personality which is hardly",Elementary Forms
41360,reconcilable with this diffusion and ubiquity. If its contours were,Elementary Forms
41360,"clearly defined, it could never spread out thus and enter into such a",Elementary Forms
41360,multitude of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it is incontestable that in this case the idea of an impersonal",Elementary Forms
41360,religious force is beginning to change; but there are other cases where,Elementary Forms
41360,it is affirmed in all its abstract purity and even reaches a higher,Elementary Forms
41360,degree of generality than in Australia. If the different totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,principles to which the various clans of a single tribe address,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves are distinct from each other, they are, none the less,",Elementary Forms
41360,comparable to each other at bottom; for all play the same role in their,Elementary Forms
41360,respective spheres. There are societies which have had the feeling of,Elementary Forms
41360,this unity with nature and have consequently advanced to the idea of a,Elementary Forms
41360,unique religious force of which all other sacred principles are only,Elementary Forms
41360,expressions and which makes the unity of the universe. As these,Elementary Forms
41360,"societies are still thoroughly impregnated with totemism, and as they",Elementary Forms
41360,remain entangled in a social organization identical with that of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australians, we may say that totemism contained this idea in",Elementary Forms
41360,potentiality.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This can be observed in a large number of American tribes, especially",Elementary Forms
41360,"those belonging to the great Sioux family: the Omaha, Ponka, Kansas,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Osage, Assiniboin, Dakota, Iowa, Winnebago, Mandan, Hidatsa, etc. Many",Elementary Forms
41360,"of these are still organized in clans, as the Omaha[620] and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Iowa;[621] others were so not long since, and, says Dorsey, it is still",Elementary Forms
41360,"possible to find among them ""all the foundations of the totemic system,",Elementary Forms
41360,"just as in the other societies of the Sioux.""[622] Now among these",Elementary Forms
41360,"peoples, above all the particular deities to whom men render a cult,",Elementary Forms
41360,there is a pre-eminent power to which all the others have the relation,Elementary Forms
41360,"of derived forms, and which is called _wakan_.[623] Owing to the",Elementary Forms
41360,preponderating place thus assigned to this principle in the Siouan,Elementary Forms
41360,"pantheon, it is sometimes regarded as a sort of sovereign god, or a",Elementary Forms
41360,"Jupiter or Jahveh, and travellers have frequently translated wakan by",Elementary Forms
41360,"""great spirit."" This is misrepresenting its real nature gravely. The",Elementary Forms
41360,wakan is in no way a personal being; the natives do not represent it in,Elementary Forms
41360,"a determined form. According to an observer cited by Dorsey, ""they say",Elementary Forms
41360,"that they have never seen the wakanda, so they cannot pretend to",Elementary Forms
41360,"personify it.""[624] It is not even possible to define it by determined",Elementary Forms
41360,"attributes and characteristics. ""No word,"" says Riggs, ""can explain the",Elementary Forms
41360,"meaning of this term among the Dakota. It embraces all mystery, all",Elementary Forms
41360,"secret power, all divinity.""[625] All the beings which the Dakota",Elementary Forms
41360,"reveres, ""the earth, the four winds, the sun, the moon and the stars,",Elementary Forms
41360,"are manifestations of this mysterious life and power"" which enters into",Elementary Forms
41360,"all. Sometimes it is represented in the form of a wind, as a breath",Elementary Forms
41360,having its seat in the four cardinal points and moving everything:[626],Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes it is a voice heard in the crashing of the thunder;[627] the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sun, moon and stars are wakan.[628] But no enumeration could exhaust",Elementary Forms
41360,"this infinitely complex idea. It is not a definite and definable power,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the power of doing this or that; it is Power in an absolute sense, with",Elementary Forms
41360,no epithet or determination of any sort. The various divine powers are,Elementary Forms
41360,only particular manifestations and personifications of it; each of them,Elementary Forms
41360,is this power seen under one of its numerous aspects.[629] It is this,Elementary Forms
41360,"which made one observer say, ""He is a protean god; he is supposed to",Elementary Forms
41360,"appear to different persons in different forms.""[630] Nor are the gods",Elementary Forms
41360,the only beings animated by it: it is the principle of all that lives or,Elementary Forms
41360,"acts or moves. ""All life is wakan. So also is everything which exhibits",Elementary Forms
41360,"power, whether in action, as the winds and drifting clouds, or in",Elementary Forms
41360,"passive endurance, as the boulder by the wayside.""[631]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Iroquois, whose social organization has an even more",Elementary Forms
41360,"pronouncedly totemic character, this, same idea is found again; the word",Elementary Forms
41360,_orenda_ which expresses it is the exact equivalent of the wakan of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Sioux. ""The savage man,"" says Hewitt, ""conceived the diverse bodies",Elementary Forms
41360,collectively constituting his environment to possess inherently mystic,Elementary Forms
41360,"potence ... (whether they be) the rocks, the waters, the tides, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"plants and the trees, the animals and man, the wind and the storms, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clouds and the thunders and the lightnings,""[632] etc. ""This potence is",Elementary Forms
41360,held to be the property of all things ... and by the inchoate mentation,Elementary Forms
41360,"of man is regarded as the efficient cause of all phenomena, all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"activities of his environment.""[633] A sorcerer or shaman has orenda,",Elementary Forms
41360,but as much would be said of a man succeeding in his enterprises. At,Elementary Forms
41360,"bottom, there is nothing in the world which does not have its quota of",Elementary Forms
41360,"orenda; but the quantities vary. There are some beings, either men or",Elementary Forms
41360,"things, which are favoured; there are others which are relatively",Elementary Forms
41360,"disinherited, and the universal life consists in the struggles of these",Elementary Forms
41360,orenda of unequal intensity. The more intense conquer the weaker. Is one,Elementary Forms
41360,man more successful than his companions in the hunt or at war? It is,Elementary Forms
41360,because he has more orenda. If an animal escapes from a hunter who is,Elementary Forms
41360,"pursuing it, it is because the orenda of the former was the more",Elementary Forms
41360,powerful.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This same idea is found among the Shoshone under the name of _pokunt_,",Elementary Forms
41360,"among the Algonquin under the name of _manitou_,[634] of _nauala_ among",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Kwakiutl,[635] of _yek_ among the Tlinkit[636] and of _sgana_ among",Elementary Forms
41360,the Haida.[637] But it is not peculiar to the Indians of North America;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is in Melanesia that it was studied for the first time. It is true,Elementary Forms
41360,"that in certain of the islands of Melanesia, social organization is no",Elementary Forms
41360,"longer on a totemic basis; but in all, totemism is still visible,[638]",Elementary Forms
41360,"in spite of what Codrington has said about it. Now among these peoples,",Elementary Forms
41360,"we find, under the name of _mana_, an idea which is the exact equivalent",Elementary Forms
41360,of the wakan of the Sioux and the orenda of the Iroquois. The definition,Elementary Forms
41360,"given by Codrington is as follows: ""There is a belief in a force",Elementary Forms
41360,"altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all ways for good",Elementary Forms
41360,and evil; and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or,Elementary Forms
41360,control. This is Mana. I think I know what our people mean by it. ... It,Elementary Forms
41360,"is a power or influence, not physical and in a way supernatural; but it",Elementary Forms
41360,"shows itself in physical force, or in any kind of power or excellence",Elementary Forms
41360,"which a man possesses. This mana is not fixed in anything, and can be",Elementary Forms
41360,"conveyed in almost anything. ... All Melanesian religion consists, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, in getting this mana for one's self, or getting it used for one's",Elementary Forms
41360,"benefit.""[639] Is this not the same notion of an anonymous and diffused",Elementary Forms
41360,"force, the germs of which we recently found in the totemism of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia? Here is the same impersonality; for, as Codrington says, we",Elementary Forms
41360,must be careful not to regard it as a sort of supreme being; any such,Elementary Forms
41360,"idea is ""absolutely foreign"" to Melanesian thought. Here is the same",Elementary Forms
41360,ubiquity; the mana is located nowhere definitely and it is everywhere.,Elementary Forms
41360,"All forms of life and all the effects of the action, either of men or",Elementary Forms
41360,"of living beings or of simple minerals, are attributed to its",Elementary Forms
41360,influence.[640],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore there is no undue temerity in attributing to the Australians,Elementary Forms
41360,an idea such as the one we have discovered in our analysis of totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs, for we find it again, but abstracted and generalized to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"higher degree, at the basis of other religions whose roots go back into",Elementary Forms
41360,a system like the Australian one and which visibly bear the mark of,Elementary Forms
41360,this. The two conceptions are obviously related; they differ only in,Elementary Forms
41360,"degree, while the mana is diffused into the whole universe, what we call",Elementary Forms
41360,"the god or, to speak more precisely, the totemic principle, is localized",Elementary Forms
41360,in the more limited circle of the beings and things of certain species.,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is mana, but a little more specialized; yet as a matter of fact, this",Elementary Forms
41360,specialization is quite relative.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, there is one case where this connection is made especially",Elementary Forms
41360,"apparent. Among the Omaha, there are totems of all sorts, both",Elementary Forms
41360,individual and collective;[641] but both are only particular forms of,Elementary Forms
41360,"wakan. ""The foundation of the Indian's faith in the efficacy of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem,"" says Miss Fletcher, ""rested upon his belief concerning nature",Elementary Forms
41360,and life. This conception was complex and involved two prominent ideas:,Elementary Forms
41360,"First, that all things, animate and inanimate, were permeated by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"common life; and second, that this life could not be broken, but was",Elementary Forms
41360,"continuous.""[642] Now this common principle of life is the wakan. The",Elementary Forms
41360,totem is the means by which an individual is put into relations with,Elementary Forms
41360,"this source of energy; if the totem has any powers, it is because it",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnates the wakan. If a man who has violated the interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,"protecting his totem is struck by sickness or death, it is because this",Elementary Forms
41360,"mysterious force against which he has thus set himself, that is, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"wakan, reacts against him with a force proportionate to the shock",Elementary Forms
41360,"received.[643] Also, just as the totem is wakan, so the wakan, in its",Elementary Forms
41360,"turn, sometimes shows its totemic origin by the way in which it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived. In fact, Say says that among the Dakota the ""wahconda"" is",Elementary Forms
41360,"manifested sometimes in the form of a grey bear, sometimes of a bison, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"beaver or some other animal.[644] Undoubtedly, this formula cannot be",Elementary Forms
41360,accepted without reserve. The wakan repels all personification and,Elementary Forms
41360,consequently it is hardly probable that it has ever been thought of in,Elementary Forms
41360,its abstract generality with the aid of such definite symbols. But Say's,Elementary Forms
41360,remark is probably applicable to the particular forms which it takes in,Elementary Forms
41360,specializing itself in the concrete reality of life. Now if there is a,Elementary Forms
41360,possibility that there was a time when these specializations of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"wakan bore witness to such an affinity for an animal form, that would be",Elementary Forms
41360,one more proof of the close bonds uniting this conception to the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs.[645],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is possible to explain why this idea has been unable to reach the,Elementary Forms
41360,same degree of abstraction in Australia as in the more advanced,Elementary Forms
41360,societies. This is not merely due to the insufficient aptitude of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian for abstracting and generalizing: before all, it is the",Elementary Forms
41360,nature of the social environment which has imposed this particularism.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, as long as totemism remains at the basis of the cultural",Elementary Forms
41360,"organization, the clan keeps an autonomy in the religious society which,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though not absolute, is always very marked. Of course we can say that in",Elementary Forms
41360,one sense each totemic group is only a chapel of the tribal Church; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is a chapel enjoying a large independence. The cult celebrated there,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though not a self-sufficing whole, has only external relations with the",Elementary Forms
41360,others; they interchange without intermingling; the totem of the clan is,Elementary Forms
41360,fully sacred only for this clan. Consequently the groups of things,Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to each clan, which are a part of it in the same way the men",Elementary Forms
41360,"are, have the same individuality and autonomy. Each of them is",Elementary Forms
41360,"represented as irreducible into similar groups, as separated from them",Elementary Forms
41360,"by a break of continuity, and as constituting a distinct realm. Under",Elementary Forms
41360,"these circumstances, it would occur to no one that these heterogeneous",Elementary Forms
41360,worlds were different manifestations of one and the same fundamental,Elementary Forms
41360,"force; on the contrary, one might suppose that each of them corresponded",Elementary Forms
41360,to an organically different mana whose action could not extend beyond,Elementary Forms
41360,the clan and the circle of things attributed to it. The idea of a single,Elementary Forms
41360,and universal mana could be born only at the moment when the tribal,Elementary Forms
41360,religion developed above that of the clans and absorbed them more or,Elementary Forms
41360,less completely. It is along with the feeling of the tribal unity that,Elementary Forms
41360,the feeling of the substantial unity of the world awakens. As we shall,Elementary Forms
41360,"presently show,[646] it is true that the Australian societies are",Elementary Forms
41360,already acquainted with a cult that is common to the tribe as a whole.,Elementary Forms
41360,But if this cult represents the highest form of the Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, it has not succeeded in touching and modifying the principles",Elementary Forms
41360,upon which they repose: totemism is essentially a federative religion,Elementary Forms
41360,which cannot go beyond a certain degree of centralization without,Elementary Forms
41360,ceasing to be itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One characteristic fact clearly shows the fundamental reason which has,Elementary Forms
41360,kept the idea of the mana so specialized in Australia. The real,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious forces, those thought of in the form of totems, are not the",Elementary Forms
41360,only ones with which the Australian feels himself obliged to reckon.,Elementary Forms
41360,There are also some over which magicians have particular control. While,Elementary Forms
41360,"the former are theoretically considered healthful and beneficent, the",Elementary Forms
41360,second have it as their especial function to cause sickness and death.,Elementary Forms
41360,And at the same time that they differ so greatly in the nature of their,Elementary Forms
41360,"effects, they are contrasted also by the relations which they sustain",Elementary Forms
41360,with the social organization. A totem is always a matter of the clan;,Elementary Forms
41360,"but on the contrary, magic is a tribal and even an intertribal",Elementary Forms
41360,institution. Magic forces do not belong to any special portion of the,Elementary Forms
41360,tribe in particular. All that is needed to make use of them is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"possession of efficient recipes. Likewise, everybody is liable to feel",Elementary Forms
41360,their effects and consequently should try to protect himself against,Elementary Forms
41360,"them. These are vague forces, specially attached to no determined social",Elementary Forms
41360,"division, and even able to spread their action beyond the tribe. Now it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a remarkable fact that among the Arunta and Loritja, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived as simple aspects and particular forms of a unique force,",Elementary Forms
41360,"called in Arunta _Arungquiltha_ or _Arunkulta_.[647] ""This is a term,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"say Spencer and Gillen, ""of somewhat vague import, but always associated",Elementary Forms
41360,at bottom with the possession of _supernatural evil power_.... The name,Elementary Forms
41360,is applied indiscriminately to the evil influence or to the object in,Elementary Forms
41360,"which it is, for the time being, or permanently, resident.""[648] ""By",Elementary Forms
41360,"arunkulta,"" says Strehlow, ""the native signifies a force which suddenly",Elementary Forms
41360,"stops life and brings death to all who come in contact with it.""[649]",Elementary Forms
41360,This name is given to the bones and pieces of wood from which,Elementary Forms
41360,"evil-working charms are derived, and also to poisonous animals and",Elementary Forms
41360,vegetables. So it may accurately be called a harmful mana. Grey mentions,Elementary Forms
41360,an absolutely identical notion among the tribes he observed.[650] Thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"among these different peoples, while the properly religious forces do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not succeed in avoiding a certain heterogeneity, magic forces are",Elementary Forms
41360,thought of as being all of the same nature; the mind represents them in,Elementary Forms
41360,their generic unity. This is because they rise above the social,Elementary Forms
41360,"organization and its divisions and subdivisions, and move in a",Elementary Forms
41360,homogeneous and continuous space where they meet with nothing to,Elementary Forms
41360,"differentiate them. The others, on the contrary, being localized in",Elementary Forms
41360,"definite and distinct social forms, are diversified and particularized",Elementary Forms
41360,in the image of the environment in which they are situated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,From this we can see how thoroughly the idea of an impersonal religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"force enters into the meaning and spirit of Australian totemism, for it",Elementary Forms
41360,disengages itself with clarity as soon as no contrary cause opposes it.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that the arungquiltha is purely a magic force. But between,Elementary Forms
41360,religious forces and magic forces there is no difference of kind:[651],Elementary Forms
41360,"sometimes they are even designated by the same name: in Melanesia, the",Elementary Forms
41360,magicians and charms have mana just like the agents and rites of the,Elementary Forms
41360,regular cult;[652] the word oranda is employed in the same way by the,Elementary Forms
41360,Iroquois.[653] So we can legitimately infer the nature of the one from,Elementary Forms
41360,that of the other.[654],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The results to which the above analysis has led us do not concern the,Elementary Forms
41360,"history of totemism only, but also the genesis of religious thought in",Elementary Forms
41360,general.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Under the pretext that in early times men were dominated by their senses,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the representations of their senses, it has frequently been held",Elementary Forms
41360,that they commenced by representing the divine in the concrete form of,Elementary Forms
41360,definite and personal beings. The facts do not confirm this presumption.,Elementary Forms
41360,We have just described a systematically united scheme of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs which we have good reason to regard as very primitive, yet we",Elementary Forms
41360,have met with no personalities of this sort. The real totemic cult is,Elementary Forms
41360,addressed neither to certain determined animals nor to certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"vegetables nor even to an animal or vegetable species, but to a vague",Elementary Forms
41360,power spread through these things.[655] Even in the most advanced,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions which have developed out of totemism, such as those which we",Elementary Forms
41360,"find among the North American Indians, this idea, instead of being",Elementary Forms
41360,"effaced, becomes more conscious of itself; it is declared with a clarity",Elementary Forms
41360,"it did not have before, while at the same time, it attains a higher",Elementary Forms
41360,generality. It is this which dominates the entire religious system.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is the original matter out of which have been constructed those,Elementary Forms
41360,beings of every sort which the religions of all times have consecrated,Elementary Forms
41360,"and adored. The spirits, demons, genii and gods of every sort are only",Elementary Forms
41360,"the concrete forms taken by this energy, or ""potentiality,"" as Hewitt",Elementary Forms
41360,"calls it,[656] in individualizing itself, in fixing itself upon a",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain determined object or point in space, or in centring around an",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideal and legendary being, though one conceived as real by the popular",Elementary Forms
41360,imagination. A Dakota questioned by Miss Fletcher expressed this,Elementary Forms
41360,essential consubstantiability of all sacred things in language that is,Elementary Forms
41360,"full of relief. ""Every thing as it moves, now and then, here and there,",Elementary Forms
41360,"makes stops. The bird as it flies stops in one place to make its nest,",Elementary Forms
41360,and in another to rest in its flight. A man when he goes forth stops,Elementary Forms
41360,"when he wills. So the god has stopped. The sun, which is so bright and",Elementary Forms
41360,"beautiful, is one place where he has stopped. The trees, the animals,",Elementary Forms
41360,"are where he has stopped, and the Indian thinks of these places and",Elementary Forms
41360,sends his prayers to reach the place where the god has stopped and to,Elementary Forms
41360,"win help and a blessing.""[657] In other words, the wakan (for this is",Elementary Forms
41360,"what he was talking about) comes and goes through the world, and sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"things are the points upon which it alights. Here we are, for once, just",Elementary Forms
41360,"as far from naturism as from animism. If the sun, the moon and the stars",Elementary Forms
41360,"have been adored, they have not owed this honour to their intrinsic",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature or their distinctive properties, but to the fact that they are",Elementary Forms
41360,thought to participate in this force which alone is able to give things,Elementary Forms
41360,"a sacred character, and which is also found in a multitude of other",Elementary Forms
41360,"beings, even the smallest. If the souls of the dead have been the object",Elementary Forms
41360,"of rites, it is not because they are believed to be made out of some",Elementary Forms
41360,"fluid and impalpable substance, nor is it because they resemble the",Elementary Forms
41360,shadow cast by a body or its reflection on a surface of water.,Elementary Forms
41360,Lightness and fluidity are not enough to confer sanctity; they have been,Elementary Forms
41360,invested with this dignity only in so far as they contained within them,Elementary Forms
41360,"something of this same force, the source of all religiosity.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are now in a better condition to understand why it has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"impossible to define religion by the idea of mythical personalities,",Elementary Forms
41360,gods or spirits; it is because this way of representing religious things,Elementary Forms
41360,is in no way inherent in their nature. What we find at the origin and,Elementary Forms
41360,basis of religious thought are not determined and distinct objects and,Elementary Forms
41360,beings possessing a sacred character of themselves; they are indefinite,Elementary Forms
41360,"powers, anonymous forces, more or less numerous in different societies,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and sometimes even reduced to a unity, and whose impersonality is",Elementary Forms
41360,strictly comparable to that of the physical forces whose manifestations,Elementary Forms
41360,"the sciences of nature study. As for particular sacred things, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,only individualized forms of this essential principle. So it is not,Elementary Forms
41360,"surprising that even in the religions where there are avowed divinities,",Elementary Forms
41360,"there are rites having an efficient virtue in themselves, independently",Elementary Forms
41360,of all divine intervention. It is because this force may be attached to,Elementary Forms
41360,words that are pronounced or movements that are made just as well as to,Elementary Forms
41360,corporal substances; the voice or the movements may serve as its,Elementary Forms
41360,"vehicle, and it may produce its effects through their intermediacy,",Elementary Forms
41360,without the aid of any god or spirit. Even should it happen to,Elementary Forms
41360,"concentrate itself especially in a rite, this will become a creator of",Elementary Forms
41360,divinities from that very fact.[658] This is why there is scarcely a,Elementary Forms
41360,divine personality who does not retain some impersonality. Those who,Elementary Forms
41360,"represent it most clearly in a concrete and visible form, think of it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"at the same time, as an abstract power which cannot be defined except by",Elementary Forms
41360,"its own efficacy, or as a force spread out in space and which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"contained, at least in part, in each of its effects. It is the power of",Elementary Forms
41360,"producing rain or wind, crops or the light of day; Zeus is in each of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the raindrops which falls, just as Ceres is in each of the sheaves of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the harvest.[659] As a general rule, in fact, this efficacy is so",Elementary Forms
41360,imperfectly determined that the believer is able to form only a very,Elementary Forms
41360,"vague notion of it. Moreover, it is this indecision which has made",Elementary Forms
41360,possible these syncretisms and duplications in the course of which gods,Elementary Forms
41360,"are broken up, dismembered and confused in every way. Perhaps there is",Elementary Forms
41360,"not a single religion in which the original mana, whether unique or",Elementary Forms
41360,"multiform, has been resolved entirely into a clearly defined number of",Elementary Forms
41360,beings who are distinct and separate from each other; each of them,Elementary Forms
41360,"always retains a touch of impersonality, as it were, which enables it to",Elementary Forms
41360,"enter into new combinations, not as the result of a simple survival but",Elementary Forms
41360,because it is the nature of religious forces to be unable to,Elementary Forms
41360,individualize themselves completely.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This conception, to which we have been led by the study of totemism",Elementary Forms
41360,"alone, has the additional recommendation that many scholars have",Elementary Forms
41360,"recently adopted it quite independently of one another, as a conclusion",Elementary Forms
41360,from very different sorts of studies. There is a tendency towards a,Elementary Forms
41360,"spontaneous agreement on this point which should be remarked, for it is",Elementary Forms
41360,a presumption of objectivity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As early as 1899, we pointed out the impossibility of making the idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,a mythical personality enter into the definition of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena.[660] In 1900, Marrett showed the existence of a religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"phase which he called _preanimistic_, in which the rites are addressed",Elementary Forms
41360,to impersonal forces like the Melanesian mana and the wakan of the Omaha,Elementary Forms
41360,"and Dakota.[661] However, Marrett did not go so far as to maintain that",Elementary Forms
41360,always and in every case the idea of a spirit is logically and,Elementary Forms
41360,chronologically posterior to that of mana and is derived from it; he,Elementary Forms
41360,even seemed disposed to admit that it has sometimes appeared,Elementary Forms
41360,"independently and consequently, that religious thought flows from a",Elementary Forms
41360,"double source.[662] On the other hand, he conceived the mana as an",Elementary Forms
41360,"inherent property of things, as an element of their appearance; for,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to him, this is simply the character which we attribute to",Elementary Forms
41360,"everything out of the ordinary, and which inspires a sentiment of fear",Elementary Forms
41360,or admiration.[663] This practically amounts to a return to the naturist,Elementary Forms
41360,theory.[664],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"A little later, MM. Hubert and Mauss, while attempting to formulate a",Elementary Forms
41360,"general theory of magic, established the fact that magic as a whole",Elementary Forms
41360,reposes on the notion of mana.[665] The close kinship of the magic rite,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the religious rite being known, it was even possible to foresee that",Elementary Forms
41360,the same theory should be applied to religion. This was sustained by,Elementary Forms
41360,Preuss in a series of articles in the _Globus_[666] that same year.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Relying chiefly upon facts taken from American civilizations, Preuss set",Elementary Forms
41360,out to prove that the ideas of the soul and spirit were not developed,Elementary Forms
41360,"until after those of power and impersonal force, that the former are",Elementary Forms
41360,"only a transformation of the latter, and that up to a relatively late",Elementary Forms
41360,"date they retain the marks of their original impersonality. In fact, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"shows that even in the advanced religions, they are represented in the",Elementary Forms
41360,form of vague emanations disengaging themselves automatically from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"things in which they reside, and even tending to escape by all the ways",Elementary Forms
41360,"that are open to them: the mouth, the nose and all the other openings of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body, the breath, the look, the word, etc. At the same time, Preuss",Elementary Forms
41360,pointed out their Protean forms and their extreme plasticity which,Elementary Forms
41360,permits them to give themselves successively and almost concurrently to,Elementary Forms
41360,the most varied uses.[667] It is true that if we stick to the letter of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the terminology employed by this author, we may believe that for him the",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces have a magic, not a religious nature: he calls them charms",Elementary Forms
41360,"(_Zauber, Zauberkraefte_). But it is evident that in expressing himself",Elementary Forms
41360,"thus, he does not intend to put them outside of religion; for it is in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the essentially religious rites that he shows their action, for example,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the great Mexican ceremonies.[668] If he uses these expressions, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is undoubtedly because he knows no others which mark better the,Elementary Forms
41360,impersonality of these forces and the sort of mechanism with which they,Elementary Forms
41360,operate.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus this same idea tends to come to light on every side.[669] The,Elementary Forms
41360,impression becomes more and more prevalent that even the most elementary,Elementary Forms
41360,mythological constructions are secondary products[670] which cover over,Elementary Forms
41360,"a system of beliefs, at once simpler and more obscure, vaguer and more",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential, which form the solid foundations upon which the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,systems are built. It is this primitive foundation which our analysis of,Elementary Forms
41360,totemism has enabled us to reach. The various writers whose studies we,Elementary Forms
41360,have just mentioned arrived at this conclusion only through facts taken,Elementary Forms
41360,"from very diverse religions, some of which even correspond to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"civilization that is already far advanced: such is the case, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, with the Mexican religions, of which Preuss makes great use. So",Elementary Forms
41360,it might be asked if this theory is equally applicable to the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"simple religions. But since it is impossible to go lower than totemism,",Elementary Forms
41360,"we are not exposed to this risk of error, and at the same time, we have",Elementary Forms
41360,an opportunity of finding the initial notion from which the ideas of,Elementary Forms
41360,wakan and mana are derived: this is the notion of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,principle.[671],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this notion is not only of primary importance because of the role it,Elementary Forms
41360,has played in the development of religious ideas; it also has a lay,Elementary Forms
41360,aspect in which it is of interest for the history of scientific thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is the first form of the idea of force.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, the wakan plays the same role in the world, as the Sioux",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceives it, as the one played by the forces with which science",Elementary Forms
41360,"explains the diverse phenomena of nature. This, however, does not mean",Elementary Forms
41360,that it is thought of as an exclusively physical energy; on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, in the next chapter we shall see that the elements going to",Elementary Forms
41360,make up this idea are taken from the most diverse realms. But this very,Elementary Forms
41360,compositeness of its nature enables it to be utilized as a universal,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle of explanation. It is from it that all life comes;[672] ""all",Elementary Forms
41360,"life is wakan""; and by this word life, we must understand everything",Elementary Forms
41360,"that acts and reacts, that moves and is moved, in both the mineral and",Elementary Forms
41360,biological kingdoms. The wakan is the cause of all the movements which,Elementary Forms
41360,take place in the universe. We have even seen that the orenda of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Iroquois is ""the efficient cause of all the phenomena and all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"activities which are manifested around men."" It is a power ""inherent in",Elementary Forms
41360,"all bodies and all things.""[673] It is the orenda which makes the wind",Elementary Forms
41360,"blow, the sun lighten and heat the earth, or animals reproduce and which",Elementary Forms
41360,"makes men strong, clever and intelligent. When the Iroquois says that",Elementary Forms
41360,the life of all nature is the product of the conflicts aroused between,Elementary Forms
41360,"the unequally intense orenda of the different beings, he only expresses,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in his own language, this modern idea that the world is a system of",Elementary Forms
41360,forces limiting and containing each other and making an equilibrium.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The Melanesian attributes this same general efficacy to his mana. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"owing to his mana that a man succeeds in hunting or fighting, that",Elementary Forms
41360,gardens give a good return or that flocks prosper. If an arrow strikes,Elementary Forms
41360,"its mark, it is because it is charged with mana; it is the same cause",Elementary Forms
41360,"which makes a net catch fish well, or a canoe ride well on the sea,[674]",Elementary Forms
41360,etc. It is true that if certain phrases of Codrington are taken,Elementary Forms
41360,"literally, mana should be the cause to which is attributed ""everything",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is beyond the ordinary power of men, outside the common processes",Elementary Forms
41360,"of nature.""[675] But from the very examples which he cites, it is quite",Elementary Forms
41360,evident that the sphere of the mana is really much more extended. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"reality, it serves to explain usual and everyday phenomena; there is",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing superhuman or supernatural in the fact that a ship sails or a,Elementary Forms
41360,"hunter catches game, etc. However, among these events of daily life,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are some so insignificant and familiar that they pass unperceived:,Elementary Forms
41360,they are not noticed and consequently no need is felt of explaining,Elementary Forms
41360,them. The concept of mana is applied only to those that are important,Elementary Forms
41360,"enough to cause reflection, and to awaken a minimum of interest and",Elementary Forms
41360,curiosity; but they are not marvellous for all that. And what is true of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the mana as well as the orenda and wakan, may be said equally well of",Elementary Forms
41360,the totemic principle. It is through this that the life of the men of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the clan and the animals or plants of the totemic species, as well as",Elementary Forms
41360,all the things which are classified under the totem and partake of its,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature, is manifested.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So the idea of force is of religious origin. It is from religion that it,Elementary Forms
41360,"has been borrowed, first by philosophy, then by the sciences. This has",Elementary Forms
41360,already been foreseen by Comte and this is why he made metaphysics the,Elementary Forms
41360,"heir of ""theology."" But he concluded from this that the idea of force is",Elementary Forms
41360,"destined to disappear from science; for, owing to its mystic origins, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"refused it all objective value. But we are going to show that, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, religious forces are real, howsoever imperfect the symbols may",Elementary Forms
41360,"be, by the aid of which they are thought of. From this it will follow",Elementary Forms
41360,that the same is true of the concept of force in general.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The proposition established in the preceding chapter determines the,Elementary Forms
41360,terms in which the problem of the origins of totemism should be posed.,Elementary Forms
41360,Since totemism is everywhere dominated by the idea of a quasi-divine,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle, imminent in certain categories of men and things and thought",Elementary Forms
41360,"of under the form of an animal or vegetable, the explanation of this",Elementary Forms
41360,religion is essentially the explanation of this belief; to arrive at,Elementary Forms
41360,"this, we must seek to learn how men have been led to construct this idea",Elementary Forms
41360,and out of what materials they have constructed it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is obviously not out of the sensations which the things serving as,Elementary Forms
41360,totems are able to arouse in the mind; we have shown that these things,Elementary Forms
41360,"are frequently insignificant. The lizard, the caterpillar, the rat, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ant, the frog, the turkey, the bream-fish, the plum-tree, the cockatoo,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc., to cite only those names which appear frequently in the lists of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian totems, are not of a nature to produce upon men these great",Elementary Forms
41360,and strong impressions which in a way resemble religious emotions and,Elementary Forms
41360,which impress a sacred character upon the objects they create. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,true that this is not the case with the stars and the great atmospheric,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena, which have, on the contrary, all that is necessary to strike",Elementary Forms
41360,"the imagination forcibly; but as a matter of fact, these serve only very",Elementary Forms
41360,exceptionally as totems. It is even probable that they were very slow in,Elementary Forms
41360,taking this office.[676] So it is not the intrinsic nature of the thing,Elementary Forms
41360,whose name the clan bears that marked it out to become the object of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"cult. Also, if the sentiments which it inspired were really the",Elementary Forms
41360,"determining cause of the totemic rites and beliefs, it would be the",Elementary Forms
41360,pre-eminently sacred thing; the animals or plants employed as totems,Elementary Forms
41360,would play an eminent part in the religious life. But we know that the,Elementary Forms
41360,centre of the cult is actually elsewhere. It is the figurative,Elementary Forms
41360,representations of this plant or animal and the totemic emblems and,Elementary Forms
41360,"symbols of every sort, which have the greatest sanctity; so it is in",Elementary Forms
41360,"them that is found the source of that religious nature, of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,real objects represented by these emblems receive only a reflection.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus the totem is before all a symbol, a material expression of",Elementary Forms
41360,something else.[677] But of what?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From the analysis to which we have been giving our attention, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,evident that it expresses and symbolizes two different sorts of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, it is the outward and visible form of what we have",Elementary Forms
41360,called the totemic principle or god. But it is also the symbol of the,Elementary Forms
41360,determined society called the clan. It is its flag; it is the sign by,Elementary Forms
41360,"which each clan distinguishes itself from the others, the visible mark",Elementary Forms
41360,"of its personality, a mark borne by everything which is a part of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clan under any title whatsoever, men, beasts or things. So if it is at",Elementary Forms
41360,"once the symbol of the god and of the society, is that not because the",Elementary Forms
41360,god and the society are only one? How could the emblem of the group have,Elementary Forms
41360,"been able to become the figure of this quasi-divinity, if the group and",Elementary Forms
41360,"the divinity were two distinct realities? The god of the clan, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic principle, can therefore be nothing else than the clan itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,personified and represented to the imagination under the visible form of,Elementary Forms
41360,the animal or vegetable which serves as totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But how has this apotheosis been possible, and how did it happen to take",Elementary Forms
41360,place in this fashion?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a general way, it is unquestionable that a society has all that is",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary to arouse the sensation of the divine in minds, merely by the",Elementary Forms
41360,power that it has over them; for to its members it is what a god is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"his worshippers. In fact, a god is, first of all, a being whom men think",Elementary Forms
41360,"of as superior to themselves, and upon whom they feel that they depend.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Whether it be a conscious personality, such as Zeus or Jahveh, or merely",Elementary Forms
41360,"abstract forces such as those in play in totemism, the worshipper, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the one case as in the other, believes himself held to certain manners",Elementary Forms
41360,of acting which are imposed upon him by the nature of the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,principle with which he feels that he is in communion. Now society also,Elementary Forms
41360,gives us the sensation of a perpetual dependence. Since it has a nature,Elementary Forms
41360,"which is peculiar to itself and different from our individual nature, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"pursues ends which are likewise special to it; but, as it cannot attain",Elementary Forms
41360,"them except through our intermediacy, it imperiously demands our aid. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"requires that, forgetful of our own interests, we make ourselves its",Elementary Forms
41360,"servitors, and it submits us to every sort of inconvenience, privation",Elementary Forms
41360,"and sacrifice, without which social life would be impossible. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,because of this that at every instant we are obliged to submit ourselves,Elementary Forms
41360,to rules of conduct and of thought which we have neither made nor,Elementary Forms
41360,"desired, and which are sometimes even contrary to our most fundamental",Elementary Forms
41360,inclinations and instincts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Even if society were unable to obtain these concessions and sacrifices,Elementary Forms
41360,"from us except by a material constraint, it might awaken in us only the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of a physical force to which we must give way of necessity, instead",Elementary Forms
41360,of that of a moral power such as religions adore. But as a matter of,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, the empire which it holds over consciences is due much less to the",Elementary Forms
41360,physical supremacy of which it has the privilege than to the moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"authority with which it is invested. If we yield to its orders, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,not merely because it is strong enough to triumph over our resistance;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is primarily because it is the object of a venerable respect.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We say that an object, whether individual or collective, inspires",Elementary Forms
41360,respect when the representation expressing it in the mind is gifted with,Elementary Forms
41360,"such a force that it automatically causes or inhibits actions, _without",Elementary Forms
41360,regard for any consideration relative to their useful or injurious,Elementary Forms
41360,effects_. When we obey somebody because of the moral authority which we,Elementary Forms
41360,"recognize in him, we follow out his opinions, not because they seem",Elementary Forms
41360,"wise, but because a certain sort of physical energy is imminent in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea that we form of this person, which conquers our will and inclines",Elementary Forms
41360,it in the indicated direction. Respect is the emotion which we,Elementary Forms
41360,experience when we feel this interior and wholly spiritual pressure,Elementary Forms
41360,operating upon us. Then we are not determined by the advantages or,Elementary Forms
41360,inconveniences of the attitude which is prescribed or recommended to us;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is by the way in which we represent to ourselves the person,Elementary Forms
41360,recommending or prescribing it. This is why commands generally take a,Elementary Forms
41360,"short, peremptory form leaving no place for hesitation; it is because,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in so far as it is a command and goes by its own force, it excludes all",Elementary Forms
41360,idea of deliberation or calculation; it gets its efficacy from the,Elementary Forms
41360,intensity of the mental state in which it is placed. It is this,Elementary Forms
41360,intensity which creates what is called a moral ascendancy.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now the ways of action to which society is strongly enough attached to,Elementary Forms
41360,"impose them upon its members, are, by that very fact, marked with a",Elementary Forms
41360,distinctive sign provocative of respect. Since they are elaborated in,Elementary Forms
41360,"common, the vigour with which they have been thought of by each",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular mind is retained in all the other minds, and reciprocally.",Elementary Forms
41360,The representations which express them within each of us have an,Elementary Forms
41360,intensity which no purely private states of consciousness could ever,Elementary Forms
41360,attain; for they have the strength of the innumerable individual,Elementary Forms
41360,representations which have served to form each of them. It is society,Elementary Forms
41360,who speaks through the mouths of those who affirm them in our presence;,Elementary Forms
41360,it is society whom we hear in hearing them; and the voice of all has an,Elementary Forms
41360,accent which that of one alone could never have.[678] The very violence,Elementary Forms
41360,"with which society reacts, by way of blame or material suppression,",Elementary Forms
41360,"against every attempted dissidence, contributes to strengthening its",Elementary Forms
41360,empire by manifesting the common conviction through this burst of,Elementary Forms
41360,"ardour.[679] In a word, when something is the object of such a state of",Elementary Forms
41360,"opinion, the representation which each individual has of it gains a",Elementary Forms
41360,power of action from its origins and the conditions in which it was,Elementary Forms
41360,"born, which even those feel who do not submit themselves to it. It tends",Elementary Forms
41360,"to repel the representations which contradict it, and it keeps them at a",Elementary Forms
41360,"distance; on the other hand, it commands those acts which will realize",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, and it does so, not by a material coercion or by the perspective of",Elementary Forms
41360,"something of this sort, but by the simple radiation of the mental energy",Elementary Forms
41360,which it contains. It has an efficacy coming solely from its psychical,Elementary Forms
41360,"properties, and it is by just this sign that moral authority is",Elementary Forms
41360,"recognized. So opinion, primarily a social thing, is a source of",Elementary Forms
41360,"authority, and it might even be asked whether all authority is not the",Elementary Forms
41360,daughter of opinion.[680] It may be objected that science is often the,Elementary Forms
41360,"antagonist of opinion, whose errors it combats and rectifies. But it",Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot succeed in this task if it does not have sufficient authority,",Elementary Forms
41360,and it can obtain this authority only from opinion itself. If a people,Elementary Forms
41360,"did not have faith in science, all the scientific demonstrations in the",Elementary Forms
41360,world would be without any influence whatsoever over their minds. Even,Elementary Forms
41360,"to-day, if science happened to resist a very strong current of public",Elementary Forms
41360,"opinion, it would risk losing its credit there.[681]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Since it is in spiritual ways that social pressure exercises itself, it",Elementary Forms
41360,could not fail to give men the idea that outside themselves there exist,Elementary Forms
41360,"one or several powers, both moral and, at the same time, efficacious,",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which they depend. They must think of these powers, at least in",Elementary Forms
41360,"part, as outside themselves, for these address them in a tone of command",Elementary Forms
41360,and sometimes even order them to do violence to their most natural,Elementary Forms
41360,inclinations. It is undoubtedly true that if they were able to see that,Elementary Forms
41360,"these influences which they feel emanate from society, then the",Elementary Forms
41360,mythological system of interpretations would never be born. But social,Elementary Forms
41360,"action follows ways that are too circuitous and obscure, and employs",Elementary Forms
41360,psychical mechanisms that are too complex to allow the ordinary observer,Elementary Forms
41360,to see whence it comes. As long as scientific analysis does not come to,Elementary Forms
41360,"teach it to them, men know well that they are acted upon, but they do",Elementary Forms
41360,not know by whom. So they must invent by themselves the idea of these,Elementary Forms
41360,"powers with which they feel themselves in connection, and from that, we",Elementary Forms
41360,are able to catch a glimpse of the way by which they were led to,Elementary Forms
41360,represent them under forms that are really foreign to their nature and,Elementary Forms
41360,to transfigure them by thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But a god is not merely an authority upon whom we depend; it is a force,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which our strength relies. The man who has obeyed his god and who,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for this reason, believes the god is with him, approaches the world with",Elementary Forms
41360,"confidence and with the feeling of an increased energy. Likewise, social",Elementary Forms
41360,"action does not confine itself to demanding sacrifices, privations and",Elementary Forms
41360,efforts from us. For the collective force is not entirely outside of us;,Elementary Forms
41360,"it does not act upon us wholly from without; but rather, since society",Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot exist except in and through individual consciousnesses,[682] this",Elementary Forms
41360,force must also penetrate us and organize itself within us; it thus,Elementary Forms
41360,becomes an integral part of our being and by that very fact this is,Elementary Forms
41360,elevated and magnified.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There are occasions when this strengthening and vivifying action of,Elementary Forms
41360,society is especially apparent. In the midst of an assembly animated by,Elementary Forms
41360,"a common passion, we become susceptible of acts and sentiments of which",Elementary Forms
41360,we are incapable when reduced to our own forces; and when the assembly,Elementary Forms
41360,"is dissolved and when, finding ourselves alone again, we fall back to",Elementary Forms
41360,"our ordinary level, we are then able to measure the height to which we",Elementary Forms
41360,have been raised above ourselves. History abounds in examples of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort. It is enough to think of the night of the Fourth of August, 1789,",Elementary Forms
41360,when an assembly was suddenly led to an act of sacrifice and abnegation,Elementary Forms
41360,"which each of its members had refused the day before, and at which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"were all surprised the day after.[683] This is why all parties,",Elementary Forms
41360,"political, economic or confessional, are careful to have periodical",Elementary Forms
41360,reunions where their members may revivify their common faith by,Elementary Forms
41360,"manifesting it in common. To strengthen those sentiments which, if left",Elementary Forms
41360,"to themselves, would soon weaken, it is sufficient to bring those who",Elementary Forms
41360,hold them together and to put them into closer and more active relations,Elementary Forms
41360,with one another. This is the explanation of the particular attitude of,Elementary Forms
41360,"a man speaking to a crowd, at least if he has succeeded in entering into",Elementary Forms
41360,communion with it. His language has a grandiloquence that would be,Elementary Forms
41360,ridiculous in ordinary circumstances; his gestures show a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"domination; his very thought is impatient of all rules, and easily falls",Elementary Forms
41360,into all sorts of excesses. It is because he feels within him an,Elementary Forms
41360,abnormal over-supply of force which overflows and tries to burst out,Elementary Forms
41360,from him; sometimes he even has the feeling that he is dominated by a,Elementary Forms
41360,moral force which is greater than he and of which he is only the,Elementary Forms
41360,interpreter. It is by this trait that we are able to recognize what has,Elementary Forms
41360,often been called the demon of oratorical inspiration. Now this,Elementary Forms
41360,exceptional increase of force is something very real; it comes to him,Elementary Forms
41360,from the very group which he addresses. The sentiments provoked by his,Elementary Forms
41360,"words come back to him, but enlarged and amplified, and to this degree",Elementary Forms
41360,they strengthen his own sentiment. The passionate energies he arouses,Elementary Forms
41360,re-echo within him and quicken his vital tone. It is no longer a simple,Elementary Forms
41360,individual who speaks; it is a group incarnate and personified.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Beside these passing and intermittent states, there are other more",Elementary Forms
41360,"durable ones, where this strengthening influence of society makes itself",Elementary Forms
41360,felt with greater consequences and frequently even with greater,Elementary Forms
41360,"brilliancy. There are periods in history when, under the influence of",Elementary Forms
41360,"some great collective shock, social interactions have become much more",Elementary Forms
41360,frequent and active. Men look for each other and assemble together more,Elementary Forms
41360,than ever. That general effervescence results which is characteristic of,Elementary Forms
41360,revolutionary or creative epochs. Now this greater activity results in,Elementary Forms
41360,a general stimulation of individual forces. Men see more and differently,Elementary Forms
41360,now than in normal times. Changes are not merely of shades and degrees;,Elementary Forms
41360,men become different. The passions moving them are of such an intensity,Elementary Forms
41360,that they cannot be satisfied except by violent and unrestrained,Elementary Forms
41360,"actions, actions of superhuman heroism or of bloody barbarism. This is",Elementary Forms
41360,"what explains the Crusades,[684] for example, or many of the scenes,",Elementary Forms
41360,"either sublime or savage, of the French Revolution.[685] Under the",Elementary Forms
41360,"influence of the general exaltation, we see the most mediocre and",Elementary Forms
41360,inoffensive bourgeois become either a hero or a butcher.[686] And so,Elementary Forms
41360,clearly are all these mental processes the ones that are also at the,Elementary Forms
41360,root of religion that the individuals themselves have often pictured the,Elementary Forms
41360,pressure before which they thus gave way in a distinctly religious form.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The Crusaders believed that they felt God present in the midst of them,",Elementary Forms
41360,enjoining them to go to the conquest of the Holy Land; Joan of Arc,Elementary Forms
41360,believed that she obeyed celestial voices.[687],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is not only in exceptional circumstances that this stimulating,Elementary Forms
41360,"action of society makes itself felt; there is not, so to speak, a moment",Elementary Forms
41360,in our lives when some current of energy does not come to us from,Elementary Forms
41360,"without. The man who has done his duty finds, in the manifestations of",Elementary Forms
41360,"every sort expressing the sympathy, esteem or affection which his",Elementary Forms
41360,"fellows have for him, a feeling of comfort, of which he does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinarily take account, but which sustains him, none the less. The",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments which society has for him raise the sentiments which he has,Elementary Forms
41360,"for himself. Because he is in moral harmony with his comrades, he has",Elementary Forms
41360,"more confidence, courage and boldness in action, just like the believer",Elementary Forms
41360,who thinks that he feels the regard of his god turned graciously towards,Elementary Forms
41360,"him. It thus produces, as it were, a perpetual sustenance for our moral",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. Since this varies with a multitude of external circumstances, as",Elementary Forms
41360,our relations with the groups about us are more or less active and as,Elementary Forms
41360,"these groups themselves vary, we cannot fail to feel that this moral",Elementary Forms
41360,support depends upon an external cause; but we do not perceive where,Elementary Forms
41360,this cause is nor what it is. So we ordinarily think of it under the,Elementary Forms
41360,"form of a moral power which, though immanent in us, represents within us",Elementary Forms
41360,"something not ourselves: this is the moral conscience, of which, by the",Elementary Forms
41360,"way, men have never made even a slightly distinct representation except",Elementary Forms
41360,by the aid of religious symbols.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In addition to these free forces which are constantly coming to renew,Elementary Forms
41360,"our own, there are others which are fixed in the methods and traditions",Elementary Forms
41360,which we employ. We speak a language that we did not make; we use,Elementary Forms
41360,instruments that we did not invent; we invoke rights that we did not,Elementary Forms
41360,found; a treasury of knowledge is transmitted to each generation that it,Elementary Forms
41360,"did not gather itself, etc. It is to society that we owe these varied",Elementary Forms
41360,"benefits of civilization, and if we do not ordinarily see the source",Elementary Forms
41360,"from which we get them, we at least know that they are not our own work.",Elementary Forms
41360,Now it is these things that give man his own place among things; a man,Elementary Forms
41360,is a man only because he is civilized. So he could not escape the,Elementary Forms
41360,feeling that outside of him there are active causes from which he gets,Elementary Forms
41360,"the characteristic attributes of his nature and which, as benevolent",Elementary Forms
41360,"powers, assist him, protect him and assure him of a privileged fate. And",Elementary Forms
41360,of course he must attribute to these powers a dignity corresponding to,Elementary Forms
41360,the great value of the good things he attributes to them.[688],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the environment in which we live seems to us to be peopled with,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces that are at once imperious and helpful, august and gracious, and",Elementary Forms
41360,with which we have relations. Since they exercise over us a pressure of,Elementary Forms
41360,"which we are conscious, we are forced to localize them outside",Elementary Forms
41360,"ourselves, just as we do for the objective causes of our sensations. But",Elementary Forms
41360,the sentiments which they inspire in us differ in nature from those,Elementary Forms
41360,which we have for simple visible objects. As long as these latter are,Elementary Forms
41360,reduced to their empirical characteristics as shown in ordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,"experience, and as long as the religious imagination has not",Elementary Forms
41360,"metamorphosed them, we entertain for them no feeling which resembles",Elementary Forms
41360,"respect, and they contain within them nothing that is able to raise us",Elementary Forms
41360,"outside ourselves. Therefore, the representations which express them",Elementary Forms
41360,appear to us to be very different from those aroused in us by collective,Elementary Forms
41360,influences. The two form two distinct and separate mental states in our,Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness, just as do the two forms of life to which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"correspond. Consequently, we get the impression that we are in relations",Elementary Forms
41360,with two distinct sorts of reality and that a sharply drawn line of,Elementary Forms
41360,demarcation separates them from each other: on the one hand is the world,Elementary Forms
41360,"of profane things, on the other, that of sacred things.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, in the present day just as much as in the past, we see society",Elementary Forms
41360,constantly creating sacred things out of ordinary ones. If it happens,Elementary Forms
41360,to fall in love with a man and if it thinks it has found in him the,Elementary Forms
41360,"principal aspirations that move it, as well as the means of satisfying",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, this man will be raised above the others and, as it were, deified.",Elementary Forms
41360,Opinion will invest him with a majesty exactly analogous to that,Elementary Forms
41360,protecting the gods. This is what has happened to so many sovereigns in,Elementary Forms
41360,"whom their age had faith: if they were not made gods, they were at least",Elementary Forms
41360,regarded as direct representatives of the deity. And the fact that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"society alone which is the author of these varieties of apotheosis, is",Elementary Forms
41360,evident since it frequently chances to consecrate men thus who have no,Elementary Forms
41360,right to it from their own merit. The simple deference inspired by men,Elementary Forms
41360,invested with high social functions is not different in nature from,Elementary Forms
41360,religious respect. It is expressed by the same movements: a man keeps at,Elementary Forms
41360,a distance from a high personage; he approaches him only with,Elementary Forms
41360,"precautions; in conversing with him, he uses other gestures and language",Elementary Forms
41360,than those used with ordinary mortals. The sentiment felt on these,Elementary Forms
41360,occasions is so closely related to the religious sentiment that many,Elementary Forms
41360,peoples have confounded the two. In order to explain the consideration,Elementary Forms
41360,"accorded to princes, nobles and political chiefs, a sacred character has",Elementary Forms
41360,"been attributed to them. In Melanesia and Polynesia, for example, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"said that an influential man has _mana_, and that his influence is due",Elementary Forms
41360,"to this _mana_.[689] However, it is evident that his situation is due",Elementary Forms
41360,solely to the importance attributed to him by public opinion. Thus the,Elementary Forms
41360,moral power conferred by opinion and that with which sacred beings are,Elementary Forms
41360,invested are at bottom of a single origin and made up of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,elements. That is why a single word is able to designate the two.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In addition to men, society also consecrates things, especially ideas.",Elementary Forms
41360,"If a belief is unanimously shared by a people, then, for the reason",Elementary Forms
41360,"which we pointed out above, it is forbidden to touch it, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,to deny it or to contest it. Now the prohibition of criticism is an,Elementary Forms
41360,interdiction like the others and proves the presence of something,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred. Even to-day, howsoever great may be the liberty which we accord",Elementary Forms
41360,"to others, a man who should totally deny progress or ridicule the human",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideal to which modern societies are attached, would produce the effect",Elementary Forms
41360,of a sacrilege. There is at least one principle which those the most,Elementary Forms
41360,devoted to the free examination of everything tend to place above,Elementary Forms
41360,"discussion and to regard as untouchable, that is to say, as sacred: this",Elementary Forms
41360,is the very principle of free examination.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This aptitude of society for setting itself up as a god or for creating,Elementary Forms
41360,gods was never more apparent than during the first years of the French,Elementary Forms
41360,"Revolution. At this time, in fact, under the influence of the general",Elementary Forms
41360,"enthusiasm, things purely laical by nature were transformed by public",Elementary Forms
41360,"opinion into sacred things: these were the Fatherland, Liberty,",Elementary Forms
41360,Reason.[690] A religion tended to become established which had its,Elementary Forms
41360,"dogmas,[691] symbols,[692] altars[693] and feasts.[694] It was to these",Elementary Forms
41360,spontaneous aspirations that the cult of Reason and the Supreme Being,Elementary Forms
41360,attempted to give a sort of official satisfaction. It is true that this,Elementary Forms
41360,religious renovation had only an ephemeral duration. But that was,Elementary Forms
41360,because the patriotic enthusiasm which at first transported the masses,Elementary Forms
41360,"soon relaxed.[695] The cause being gone, the effect could not remain.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But this experiment, though short-lived, keeps all its sociological",Elementary Forms
41360,interest. It remains true that in one determined case we have seen,Elementary Forms
41360,"society and its essential ideas become, directly and with no",Elementary Forms
41360,"transfiguration of any sort, the object of a veritable cult.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,All these facts allow us to catch glimpses of how the clan was able to,Elementary Forms
41360,awaken within its members the idea that outside of them there exist,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces which dominate them and at the same time sustain them, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say in fine, religious forces: it is because there is no society with",Elementary Forms
41360,which the primitive is more directly and closely connected. The bonds,Elementary Forms
41360,uniting him to the tribe are much more lax and more feebly felt.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Although this is not at all strange or foreign to him, it is with the",Elementary Forms
41360,people of his own clan that he has the greatest number of things in,Elementary Forms
41360,common; it is the action of this group that he feels the most directly;,Elementary Forms
41360,"so it is this also which, in preference to all others, should express",Elementary Forms
41360,itself in religious symbols.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But this first explanation has been too general, for it is applicable to",Elementary Forms
41360,"every sort of society indifferently, and consequently to every sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,religion. Let us attempt to determine exactly what form this collective,Elementary Forms
41360,action takes in the clan and how it arouses the sensation of sacredness,Elementary Forms
41360,there. For there is no place where it is more easily observable or more,Elementary Forms
41360,apparent in its results.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The life of the Australian societies passes alternately through two,Elementary Forms
41360,distinct phases.[696] Sometimes the population is broken up into little,Elementary Forms
41360,"groups who wander about independently of one another, in their various",Elementary Forms
41360,"occupations; each family lives by itself, hunting and fishing, and in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"word, trying to procure its indispensable food by all the means in its",Elementary Forms
41360,"power. Sometimes, on the contrary, the population concentrates and",Elementary Forms
41360,gathers at determined points for a length of time varying from several,Elementary Forms
41360,days to several months. This concentration takes place when a clan or a,Elementary Forms
41360,"part of the tribe[697] is summoned to the gathering, and on this",Elementary Forms
41360,"occasion they celebrate a religious ceremony, or else hold what is",Elementary Forms
41360,called a corrobbori[698] in the usual ethnological language.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These two phases are contrasted with each other in the sharpest way. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"the first, economic activity is the preponderating one, and it is",Elementary Forms
41360,generally of a very mediocre intensity. Gathering the grains or herbs,Elementary Forms
41360,"that are necessary for food, or hunting and fishing are not occupations",Elementary Forms
41360,to awaken very lively passions.[699] The dispersed condition in which,Elementary Forms
41360,"the society finds itself results in making its life uniform, languishing",Elementary Forms
41360,"and dull.[700] But when a corrobbori takes place, everything changes.",Elementary Forms
41360,Since the emotional and passional faculties of the primitive are only,Elementary Forms
41360,"imperfectly placed under the control of his reason and will, he easily",Elementary Forms
41360,loses control of himself. Any event of some importance puts him quite,Elementary Forms
41360,outside himself. Does he receive good news? There are at once transports,Elementary Forms
41360,"of enthusiasm. In the contrary conditions, he is to be seen running here",Elementary Forms
41360,"and there like a madman, giving himself up to all sorts of immoderate",Elementary Forms
41360,"movements, crying, shrieking, rolling in the dust, throwing it in every",Elementary Forms
41360,"direction, biting himself, brandishing his arms in a furious manner,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.[701] The very fact of the concentration acts as an exceptionally,Elementary Forms
41360,"powerful stimulant. When they are once come together, a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,electricity is formed by their collecting which quickly transports them,Elementary Forms
41360,to an extraordinary degree of exaltation. Every sentiment expressed,Elementary Forms
41360,"finds a place without resistance in all the minds, which are very open",Elementary Forms
41360,"to outside impressions; each re-echoes the others, and is re-echoed by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the others. The initial impulse thus proceeds, growing as it goes, as an",Elementary Forms
41360,avalanche grows in its advance. And as such active passions so free from,Elementary Forms
41360,"all control could not fail to burst out, on every side one sees nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,"but violent gestures, cries, veritable howls, and deafening noises of",Elementary Forms
41360,"every sort, which aid in intensifying still more the state of mind which",Elementary Forms
41360,they manifest. And since a collective sentiment cannot express itself,Elementary Forms
41360,collectively except on the condition of observing a certain order,Elementary Forms
41360,"permitting co-operation and movements in unison, these gestures and",Elementary Forms
41360,cries naturally tend to become rhythmic and regular; hence come songs,Elementary Forms
41360,"and dances. But in taking a more regular form, they lose nothing of",Elementary Forms
41360,their natural violence; a regulated tumult remains tumult. The human,Elementary Forms
41360,voice is not sufficient for the task; it is reinforced by means of,Elementary Forms
41360,artificial processes: boomerangs are beaten against each other;,Elementary Forms
41360,"bull-roarers are whirled. It is probable that these instruments, the use",Elementary Forms
41360,"of which is so general in the Australian religious ceremonies, are used",Elementary Forms
41360,primarily to express in a more adequate fashion the agitation felt. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"while they express it, they also strengthen it. This effervescence often",Elementary Forms
41360,reaches such a point that it causes unheard-of actions. The passions,Elementary Forms
41360,released are of such an impetuosity that they can be restrained by,Elementary Forms
41360,"nothing. They are so far removed from their ordinary conditions of life,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and they are so thoroughly conscious of it, that they feel that they",Elementary Forms
41360,must set themselves outside of and above their ordinary morals. The,Elementary Forms
41360,sexes unite contrarily to the rules governing sexual relations. Men,Elementary Forms
41360,"exchange wives with each other. Sometimes even incestuous unions, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"in normal times are thought abominable and are severely punished, are",Elementary Forms
41360,now contracted openly and with impunity.[702] If we add to all this that,Elementary Forms
41360,the ceremonies generally take place at night in a darkness pierced here,Elementary Forms
41360,"and there by the light of fires, we can easily imagine what effect such",Elementary Forms
41360,scenes ought to produce on the minds of those who participate. They,Elementary Forms
41360,produce such a violent super-excitation of the whole physical and mental,Elementary Forms
41360,life that it cannot be supported very long: the actor taking the,Elementary Forms
41360,principal part finally falls exhausted on the ground.[703],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"To illustrate and make specific this necessarily schematic picture, let",Elementary Forms
41360,us describe certain scenes taken from Spencer and Gillen.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One of the most important religious ceremonies among the Warramunga is,Elementary Forms
41360,the one concerning the snake Wollunqua. It consists in a series of,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies lasting through several days. On the fourth day comes the,Elementary Forms
41360,following scene.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to the ceremonial used among the Warramunga, representatives",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the two phratries take part, one as officiants, the other as",Elementary Forms
41360,preparers and assistants. Only the members of the Uluuru phratry are,Elementary Forms
41360,"qualified to celebrate the rite, but the members of the Kingilli phratry",Elementary Forms
41360,"must decorate the actors, make ready the place and the instruments, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"play the part of an audience. In this capacity, they were charged with",Elementary Forms
41360,"making a sort of mound in advance out of wet sand, upon which a design",Elementary Forms
41360,is marked with red down which represents the snake Wollunqua. The real,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony only commenced after nightfall. Towards ten or eleven o'clock,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Uluuru and Kingilli men arrived on the ground, sat down on the mound",Elementary Forms
41360,and commenced to sing. Everyone was evidently very excited. A little,Elementary Forms
41360,"later in the evening, the Uluuru brought up their wives and gave them",Elementary Forms
41360,"over to the Kingilli,[704] who had intercourse with them. Then the",Elementary Forms
41360,recently initiated young men were brought in and the whole ceremony was,Elementary Forms
41360,"explained to them in detail, and until three o'clock in the morning",Elementary Forms
41360,singing went on without a pause. Then followed a scene of the wildest,Elementary Forms
41360,"excitement. While fires were lighted on all sides, making the whiteness",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the gum-trees stand out sharply against the surrounding darkness, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Uluuru knelt down one behind another beside the mound, then rising from",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ground they went around it, with a movement in unison, their two",Elementary Forms
41360,"hands resting upon their thighs, then a little farther on they knelt",Elementary Forms
41360,"down again, and so on. At the same time they swayed their bodies, now to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the right and now to the left, while uttering at each movement a",Elementary Forms
41360,"piercing cry, a veritable yell, ""_Yrrsh! Yrrsh! Yrrsh!_"" In the meantime",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Kingilli, in a state of great excitement, clanged their boomerangs",Elementary Forms
41360,and their chief was even more agitated than his companions. When the,Elementary Forms
41360,"procession of the Uluuru had twice gone around the mound, quitting the",Elementary Forms
41360,"kneeling position, they sat down and commenced to sing again; at moments",Elementary Forms
41360,"the singing died away, then suddenly took up again. When day commenced",Elementary Forms
41360,"to dawn, all leaped to their feet; the fires that had gone out were",Elementary Forms
41360,"relighted and the Uluuru, urged on by the Kingilli, attacked the mound",Elementary Forms
41360,"furiously with boomerangs, lances and clubs; in a few minutes it was",Elementary Forms
41360,torn to pieces. The fires died away and profound silence reigned,Elementary Forms
41360,again.[705],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A still more violent scene at which these same observers assisted was in,Elementary Forms
41360,connection with the fire ceremonies among the Warramunga.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Commencing at nightfall, all sorts of processions, dances and songs had",Elementary Forms
41360,taken place by torchlight; the general effervescence was constantly,Elementary Forms
41360,"increasing. At a given moment, twelve assistants each took a great",Elementary Forms
41360,"lighted torch in their hands, and one of them holding his like a",Elementary Forms
41360,"bayonet, charged into a group of natives. Blows were warded off with",Elementary Forms
41360,clubs and spears. A general melee followed. The men leaped and pranced,Elementary Forms
41360,"about, uttering savage yells all the time; the burning torches",Elementary Forms
41360,"continually came crashing down on the heads and bodies of the men,",Elementary Forms
41360,"scattering lighted sparks in every direction. ""The smoke, the blazing",Elementary Forms
41360,"torches, the showers of sparks falling in all directions and the masses",Elementary Forms
41360,"of dancing, yelling men,"" say Spencer and Gillen, ""formed altogether a",Elementary Forms
41360,genuinely wild and savage scene of which it is impossible to convey any,Elementary Forms
41360,"adequate idea in words.""[706]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"One can readily conceive how, when arrived at this state of exaltation,",Elementary Forms
41360,a man does not recognize himself any longer. Feeling himself dominated,Elementary Forms
41360,and carried away by some sort of an external power which makes him think,Elementary Forms
41360,"and act differently than in normal times, he naturally has the",Elementary Forms
41360,impression of being himself no longer. It seems to him that he has,Elementary Forms
41360,become a new being: the decorations he puts on and the masks that cover,Elementary Forms
41360,"his face figure materially in this interior transformation, and to a",Elementary Forms
41360,"still greater extent, they aid in determining its nature. And as at the",Elementary Forms
41360,same time all his companions feel themselves transformed in the same way,Elementary Forms
41360,"and express this sentiment by their cries, their gestures and their",Elementary Forms
41360,"general attitude, everything is just as though he really were",Elementary Forms
41360,"transported into a special world, entirely different from the one where",Elementary Forms
41360,"he ordinarily lives, and into an environment filled with exceptionally",Elementary Forms
41360,intense forces that take hold of him and metamorphose him. How could,Elementary Forms
41360,"such experiences as these, especially when they are repeated every day.",Elementary Forms
41360,"for weeks, fail to leave in him the conviction that there really exist",Elementary Forms
41360,two heterogeneous and mutually incomparable worlds? One is that where,Elementary Forms
41360,his daily life drags wearily along; but he cannot penetrate into the,Elementary Forms
41360,other without at once entering into relations with extraordinary powers,Elementary Forms
41360,"that excite him to the point of frenzy. The first is the profane world,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the second, that of sacred things.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So it is in the midst of these effervescent social environments and out,Elementary Forms
41360,of this effervescence itself that the religious idea seems to be born.,Elementary Forms
41360,The theory that this is really its origin is confirmed by the fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,in Australia the really religious activity is almost entirely confined,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the moments when these assemblies are held. To be sure, there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,people among whom the great solemnities of the cult are not more or less,Elementary Forms
41360,"periodic; but in the more advanced societies, there is not, so to speak,",Elementary Forms
41360,a day when some prayer or offering is not addressed to the gods and some,Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual act is not performed. But in Australia, on the contrary, apart",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the celebrations of the clan and tribe, the time is nearly all",Elementary Forms
41360,filled with lay and profane occupations. Of course there are,Elementary Forms
41360,prohibitions that should be and are preserved even during these periods,Elementary Forms
41360,of temporal activity; it is never permissible to kill or eat freely of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic animal, at least in those parts where the interdiction has",Elementary Forms
41360,retained its original vigour; but almost no positive rites are then,Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrated, and there are no ceremonies of any importance. These take",Elementary Forms
41360,place only in the midst of assembled groups. The religious life of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian passes through successive phases of complete lull and of,Elementary Forms
41360,"super-excitation, and social life oscillates in the same rhythm. This",Elementary Forms
41360,"puts clearly into evidence the bond uniting them to one another, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"among the peoples called civilized, the relative continuity of the two",Elementary Forms
41360,blurs their relations. It might even be asked whether the violence of,Elementary Forms
41360,this contrast was not necessary to disengage the feeling of sacredness,Elementary Forms
41360,in its first form. By concentrating itself almost entirely in certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"determined moments, the collective life has been able to attain its",Elementary Forms
41360,"greatest intensity and efficacy, and consequently to give men a more",Elementary Forms
41360,active sentiment of the double existence they lead and of the double,Elementary Forms
41360,nature in which they participate.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But this explanation is still incomplete. We have shown how the clan, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the manner in which it acts upon its members, awakens within them the",Elementary Forms
41360,idea of external forces which dominate them and exalt them; but we must,Elementary Forms
41360,still demand how it happens that these forces are thought of under the,Elementary Forms
41360,"form of totems, that is to say, in the shape of an animal or plant.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is because this animal or plant has given its name to the clan and,Elementary Forms
41360,"serves it as emblem. In fact, it is a well-known law that the sentiments",Elementary Forms
41360,aroused in us by something spontaneously attach themselves to the symbol,Elementary Forms
41360,"which represents them. For us, black is a sign of mourning; it also",Elementary Forms
41360,suggests sad impressions and ideas. This transference of sentiments,Elementary Forms
41360,comes simply from the fact that the idea of a thing and the idea of its,Elementary Forms
41360,symbol are closely united in our minds; the result is that the emotions,Elementary Forms
41360,provoked by the one extend contagiously to the other. But this,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagion, which takes place in every case to a certain degree, is much",Elementary Forms
41360,"more complete and more marked when the symbol is something simple,",Elementary Forms
41360,"definite and easily representable, while the thing itself, owing to its",Elementary Forms
41360,"dimensions, the number of its parts and the complexity of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"arrangement, is difficult to hold in the mind. For we are unable to",Elementary Forms
41360,"consider an abstract entity, which we can represent only laboriously and",Elementary Forms
41360,"confusedly, the source of the strong sentiments which we feel. We cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,explain them to ourselves except by connecting them to some concrete,Elementary Forms
41360,object of whose reality we are vividly aware. Then if the thing itself,Elementary Forms
41360,"does not fulfil this condition, it cannot serve as the accepted basis of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the sentiments felt, even though it may be what really aroused them.",Elementary Forms
41360,Then some sign takes its place; it is to this that we connect the,Elementary Forms
41360,"emotions it excites. It is this which is loved, feared, respected; it is",Elementary Forms
41360,to this that we are grateful; it is for this that we sacrifice,Elementary Forms
41360,"ourselves. The soldier who dies for his flag, dies for his country; but",Elementary Forms
41360,"as a matter of fact, in his own consciousness, it is the flag that has",Elementary Forms
41360,the first place. It sometimes happens that this even directly determines,Elementary Forms
41360,action. Whether one isolated standard remains in the hands of the enemy,Elementary Forms
41360,"or not does not determine the fate of the country, yet the soldier",Elementary Forms
41360,allows himself to be killed to regain it. He loses sight of the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"that the flag is only a sign, and that it has no value in itself, but",Elementary Forms
41360,only brings to mind the reality that it represents; it is treated as if,Elementary Forms
41360,it were this reality itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural that the,Elementary Forms
41360,impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds--impressions of,Elementary Forms
41360,dependence and of increased vitality--should fix themselves to the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,of the totem rather than that of the clan: for the clan is too complex a,Elementary Forms
41360,reality to be represented clearly in all its complex unity by such,Elementary Forms
41360,"rudimentary intelligences. More than that, the primitive does not even",Elementary Forms
41360,see that these impressions come to him from the group. He does not know,Elementary Forms
41360,that the coming together of a number of men associated in the same life,Elementary Forms
41360,"results in disengaging new energies, which transform each of them. All",Elementary Forms
41360,that he knows is that he is raised above himself and that he sees a,Elementary Forms
41360,"different life from the one he ordinarily leads. However, he must",Elementary Forms
41360,connect these sensations to some external object as their cause. Now,Elementary Forms
41360,what does he see about him? On every side those things which appeal to,Elementary Forms
41360,his senses and strike his imagination are the numerous images of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem. They are the waninga and the nurtunja, which are symbols of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred being. They are churinga and bull-roarers, upon which are",Elementary Forms
41360,generally carved combinations of lines having the same significance.,Elementary Forms
41360,"They are the decorations covering the different parts of his body,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which are totemic marks. How could this image, repeated everywhere and",Elementary Forms
41360,"in all sorts of forms, fail to stand out with exceptional relief in his",Elementary Forms
41360,"mind? Placed thus in the centre of the scene, it becomes representative.",Elementary Forms
41360,"The sentiments experienced fix themselves upon it, for it is the only",Elementary Forms
41360,concrete object upon which they can fix themselves. It continues to,Elementary Forms
41360,bring them to mind and to evoke them even after the assembly has,Elementary Forms
41360,"dissolved, for it survives the assembly, being carved upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"instruments of the cult, upon the sides of rocks, upon bucklers, etc. By",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, the emotions experienced are perpetually sustained and revived.",Elementary Forms
41360,Everything happens just as if they inspired them directly. It is still,Elementary Forms
41360,"more natural to attribute them to it for, since they are common to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"group, they can be associated only with something that is equally common",Elementary Forms
41360,to all. Now the totemic emblem is the only thing satisfying this,Elementary Forms
41360,"condition. By definition, it is common to all. During the ceremony, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is the centre of all regards. While generations change, it remains the",Elementary Forms
41360,same; it is the permanent element of the social life. So it is from it,Elementary Forms
41360,that those mysterious forces seem to emanate with which men feel that,Elementary Forms
41360,"they are related, and thus they have been led to represent these forces",Elementary Forms
41360,under the form of the animate or inanimate being whose name the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,bears.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When this point is once established, we are in a position to understand",Elementary Forms
41360,all that is essential in the totemic beliefs.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Since religious force is nothing other than the collective and anonymous,Elementary Forms
41360,"force of the clan, and since this can be represented in the mind only in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the form of the totem, the totemic emblem is like the visible body of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the god. Therefore, it is from it that those kindly or dreadful actions",Elementary Forms
41360,"seem to emanate, which the cult seeks to provoke or prevent;",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently, it is to it that the cult is addressed. This is the",Elementary Forms
41360,explanation of why it holds the first place in the series of sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But the clan, like every other sort of society, can live only in and",Elementary Forms
41360,through the individual consciousnesses that compose it. So if religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"force, in so far as it is conceived as incorporated in the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"emblem, appears to be outside of the individuals and to be endowed with",Elementary Forms
41360,"a sort of transcendence over them, it, like the clan of which it is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"symbol, can be realized only in and through them; in this sense, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,imminent in them and they necessarily represent it as such. They feel it,Elementary Forms
41360,"present and active within them, for, it is this which raises them to a",Elementary Forms
41360,superior life. This is why men have believed that they contain within,Elementary Forms
41360,"them a principle comparable to the one residing in the totem, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently, why they have attributed a sacred character to themselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,but one less marked than that of the emblem. It is because the emblem,Elementary Forms
41360,is the pre-eminent source of the religious life; the man participates in,Elementary Forms
41360,"it only indirectly, as he is well aware; he takes into account the fact",Elementary Forms
41360,that the force that transports him into the world of sacred things is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not inherent in him, but comes to him from the outside.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But for still another reason, the animals or vegetables of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"species should have the same character, and even to a higher degree. If",Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic principle is nothing else than the clan, it is the clan",Elementary Forms
41360,thought of under the material form of the totemic emblem; now this form,Elementary Forms
41360,is also that of the concrete beings whose name the clan bears. Owing to,Elementary Forms
41360,"this resemblance, they could not fail to evoke sentiments analogous to",Elementary Forms
41360,those aroused by the emblem itself. Since the latter is the object of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious respect, they too should inspire respect of the same sort and",Elementary Forms
41360,"appear to be sacred. Having external forms so nearly identical, it would",Elementary Forms
41360,be impossible for the native not to attribute to them forces of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. It is therefore forbidden to kill or eat the totemic animal,",Elementary Forms
41360,since its flesh is believed to have the positive virtues resulting from,Elementary Forms
41360,"the rites; it is because it resembles the emblem of the clan, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, it is in its own image. And since the animal naturally resembles",Elementary Forms
41360,"the emblem more than the man does, it is placed on a superior rank in",Elementary Forms
41360,the hierarchy of sacred things. Between these two beings there is,Elementary Forms
41360,"undoubtedly a close relationship, for they both partake of the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"essence: both incarnate something of the totemic principle. However,",Elementary Forms
41360,"since the principle itself is conceived under an animal form, the animal",Elementary Forms
41360,"seems to incarnate it more fully than the man. Therefore, if men",Elementary Forms
41360,"consider it and treat it as a brother, it is at least as an elder",Elementary Forms
41360,brother.[707],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But even if the totemic principle has its preferred seat in a determined,Elementary Forms
41360,"species of animal or vegetable, it cannot remain localized there. A",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred character is to a high degree contagious;[708] it therefore,Elementary Forms
41360,spreads out from the totemic being to everything that is closely or,Elementary Forms
41360,remotely connected with it. The religious sentiments inspired by the,Elementary Forms
41360,animal are communicated to the substances upon which it is nourished and,Elementary Forms
41360,"which serve to make or remake its flesh and blood, to the things that",Elementary Forms
41360,"resemble it, and to the different beings with which it has constant",Elementary Forms
41360,"relations. Thus, little by little, sub-totems are attached to the totems",Elementary Forms
41360,and from the cosmological systems expressed by the primitive,Elementary Forms
41360,"classifications. At last, the whole world is divided up among the",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic principles of each tribe.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are now able to explain the origin of the ambiguity of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces as they appear in history, and how they are physical as well as",Elementary Forms
41360,"human, moral as well as material. They are moral powers because they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"made up entirely of the impressions this moral being, the group, arouses",Elementary Forms
41360,"in those other moral beings, its individual members; they do not",Elementary Forms
41360,"translate the manner in which physical things affect our senses, but the",Elementary Forms
41360,way in which the collective consciousness acts upon individual,Elementary Forms
41360,consciousnesses. Their authority is only one form of the moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"ascendancy of society over its members. But, on the other hand, since",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are conceived of under material forms, they could not fail to be",Elementary Forms
41360,regarded as closely related to material things.[709] Therefore they,Elementary Forms
41360,"dominate the two worlds. Their residence is in men, but at the same time",Elementary Forms
41360,they are the vital principles of things. They animate minds and,Elementary Forms
41360,"discipline them, but it is also they who make plants grow and animals",Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce. It is this double nature which has enabled religion to be,Elementary Forms
41360,like the womb from which come all the leading germs of human,Elementary Forms
41360,"civilization. Since it has been made to embrace all of reality, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"physical world as well as the moral one, the forces that move bodies as",Elementary Forms
41360,well as those that move minds have been conceived in a religious form.,Elementary Forms
41360,"That is how the most diverse methods and practices, both those that make",Elementary Forms
41360,"possible the continuation of the moral life (law, morals, beaux-arts)",Elementary Forms
41360,"and those serving the material life (the natural, technical and",Elementary Forms
41360,"practical sciences), are either directly or indirectly derived from",Elementary Forms
41360,religion.[710],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The first religious conceptions have often been attributed to feelings,Elementary Forms
41360,"of weakness and dependence, of fear and anguish which seized men when",Elementary Forms
41360,they came into contact with the world. Being the victims of nightmares,Elementary Forms
41360,"of which they were themselves the creators, they believed themselves",Elementary Forms
41360,surrounded by hostile and redoubtable powers which their rites sought to,Elementary Forms
41360,appease. We have now shown that the first religions were of a wholly,Elementary Forms
41360,different origin. The famous formula _Primus in orbe deos fecit timor_,Elementary Forms
41360,is in no way justified by the facts. The primitive does not regard his,Elementary Forms
41360,"gods as foreigners, enemies or thoroughly and necessarily malevolent",Elementary Forms
41360,beings whose favours he must acquire at any price; quite on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, they are rather friends, kindred or natural protectors for",Elementary Forms
41360,him. Are these not the names he gives to the beings of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,species? The power to which the cult is addressed is not represented as,Elementary Forms
41360,soaring high above him and overwhelming him by its superiority; on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, it is very near to him and confers upon him very useful powers",Elementary Forms
41360,which he could never acquire by himself. Perhaps the deity has never,Elementary Forms
41360,"been nearer to men than at this period of history, when it is present in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the things filling their immediate environment and is, in part, imminent",Elementary Forms
41360,"in himself. In fine, the sentiments at the root of totemism are those of",Elementary Forms
41360,happy confidence rather than of terror and compression. If we set aside,Elementary Forms
41360,the funeral rites--the sober side of every religion--we find the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"cult celebrated in the midst of songs, dances and dramatic",Elementary Forms
41360,"representations. As we shall see, cruel expiations are relatively rare;",Elementary Forms
41360,even the painful and obligatory mutilations of the initiations are not,Elementary Forms
41360,of this character. The terrible and jealous gods appear but slowly in,Elementary Forms
41360,the religious evolution. This is because primitive societies are not,Elementary Forms
41360,those huge Leviathans which overwhelm a man by the enormity of their,Elementary Forms
41360,power and place him under a severe discipline;[711] he gives himself up,Elementary Forms
41360,to them spontaneously and without resistance. As the social soul is then,Elementary Forms
41360,"made up of only a small number of ideas and sentiments, it easily",Elementary Forms
41360,becomes wholly incarnate in each individual consciousness. The,Elementary Forms
41360,individual carries it all inside of him; it is a part of him and,Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently, when he gives himself up to the impulses inspired by it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he does not feel that he is giving way before compulsion, but that he is",Elementary Forms
41360,going where his nature calls him.[712],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This way of understanding the origins of religious thought escapes the,Elementary Forms
41360,objections raised against the most accredited classical theories.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have seen how the naturists and animists pretend to construct the,Elementary Forms
41360,idea of sacred beings out of the sensations evoked in us by different,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena of the physical or biological order, and we have shown how",Elementary Forms
41360,this enterprise is impossible and even self-contradictory. Nothing is,Elementary Forms
41360,"worth nothing. The impressions produced in us by the physical world can,",Elementary Forms
41360,"by definition, contain nothing that surpasses this world. Out of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"visible, only the visible can be made; out of that which is heard, we",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot make something not heard. Then to explain how the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacredness has been able to take form under these conditions, the",Elementary Forms
41360,majority of the theorists have been obliged to admit that men have,Elementary Forms
41360,"superimposed upon reality, such as it is given by observation, an unreal",Elementary Forms
41360,"world, constructed entirely out of the fantastic images which agitate",Elementary Forms
41360,"his mind during a dream, or else out of the frequently monstrous",Elementary Forms
41360,aberrations produced by the mythological imagination under the,Elementary Forms
41360,bewitching but deceiving influence of language. But it remained,Elementary Forms
41360,incomprehensible that humanity should have remained obstinate in these,Elementary Forms
41360,"errors through the ages, for experience should have very quickly proven",Elementary Forms
41360,them false.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But from our point of view, these difficulties disappear. Religion",Elementary Forms
41360,ceases to be an inexplicable hallucination and takes a foothold in,Elementary Forms
41360,"reality. In fact, we can say that the believer is not deceived when he",Elementary Forms
41360,believes in the existence of a moral power upon which he depends and,Elementary Forms
41360,"from which he receives all that is best in himself: this power exists,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is society. When the Australian is carried outside himself and feels,Elementary Forms
41360,"a new life flowing within him whose intensity surprises him, he is not",Elementary Forms
41360,the dupe of an illusion; this exaltation is real and is really the,Elementary Forms
41360,effect of forces outside of and superior to the individual. It is true,Elementary Forms
41360,that he is wrong in thinking that this increase of vitality is the work,Elementary Forms
41360,of a power in the form of some animal or plant. But this error is merely,Elementary Forms
41360,in regard to the letter of the symbol by which this being is represented,Elementary Forms
41360,to the mind and the external appearance which the imagination has given,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, and not in regard to the fact of its existence. Behind these figures",Elementary Forms
41360,"and metaphors, be they gross or refined, there is a concrete and living",Elementary Forms
41360,reality. Thus religion acquires a meaning and a reasonableness that the,Elementary Forms
41360,most intransigent rationalist cannot misunderstand. Its primary object,Elementary Forms
41360,is not to give men a representation of the physical world; for if that,Elementary Forms
41360,"were its essential task, we could not understand how it has been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,"survive, for, on this side, it is scarcely more than a fabric of errors.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Before all, it is a system of ideas with which the individuals represent",Elementary Forms
41360,"to themselves the society of which they are members, and the obscure but",Elementary Forms
41360,intimate relations which they have with it. This is its primary,Elementary Forms
41360,"function; and though metaphorical and symbolic, this representation is",Elementary Forms
41360,"not unfaithful. Quite on the contrary, it translates everything",Elementary Forms
41360,essential in the relations which are to be explained: for it is an,Elementary Forms
41360,"eternal truth that outside of us there exists something greater than us,",Elementary Forms
41360,with which we enter into communion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,That is why we can rest assured in advance that the practices of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"cult, whatever they may be, are something more than movements without",Elementary Forms
41360,importance and gestures without efficacy. By the mere fact that their,Elementary Forms
41360,apparent function is to strengthen the bonds attaching the believer to,Elementary Forms
41360,"his god, they at the same time really strengthen the bonds attaching the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual to the society of which he is a member, since the god is only",Elementary Forms
41360,a figurative expression of the society. We are even able to understand,Elementary Forms
41360,how the fundamental truth thus contained in religion has been able to,Elementary Forms
41360,"compensate for the secondary errors which it almost necessarily implies,",Elementary Forms
41360,and how believers have consequently been restrained from tearing,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves off from it, in spite of the misunderstandings which must",Elementary Forms
41360,result from these errors. It is undeniably true that the recipes which,Elementary Forms
41360,it recommends that men use to act upon things are generally found to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"ineffective. But these checks can have no profound influence, for they",Elementary Forms
41360,do not touch religion in its fundamentals.[713],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it may be objected that even according to this hypothesis,",Elementary Forms
41360,religion remains the object of a certain delirium. What other name can,Elementary Forms
41360,"we give to that state when, after a collective effervescence, men",Elementary Forms
41360,believe themselves transported into an entirely different world from the,Elementary Forms
41360,one they have before their eyes?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is certainly true that religious life cannot attain a certain degree,Elementary Forms
41360,of intensity without implying a psychical exaltation not far removed,Elementary Forms
41360,"from delirium. That is why the prophets, the founders of religions, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"great saints, in a word, the men whose religious consciousness is",Elementary Forms
41360,"exceptionally sensitive, very frequently give signs of an excessive",Elementary Forms
41360,nervousness that is even pathological: these physiological defects,Elementary Forms
41360,predestined them to great religious roles. The ritual use of,Elementary Forms
41360,intoxicating liquors is to be explained in the same way.[714] Of course,Elementary Forms
41360,this does not mean that an ardent religious faith is necessarily the,Elementary Forms
41360,fruit of the drunkenness and mental derangement which accompany it; but,Elementary Forms
41360,as experience soon informed people of the similarities between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mentality of a delirious person and that of a seer, they sought to open",Elementary Forms
41360,"a way to the second by artificially exciting the first. But if, for this",Elementary Forms
41360,"reason, it may be said that religion is not without a certain delirium,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it must be added that this delirium, if it has the causes which we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to it, _is well-founded_. The images out of which it is made",Elementary Forms
41360,are not pure illusions like those the naturists and animists put at the,Elementary Forms
41360,basis of religion; they correspond to something in reality. Of course it,Elementary Forms
41360,is only natural that the moral forces they express should be unable to,Elementary Forms
41360,affect the human mind powerfully without pulling it outside itself and,Elementary Forms
41360,"without plunging it into a state that may be called _ecstatic_, provided",Elementary Forms
41360,that the word be taken in its etymological sense ([Greek: ekstasis]);,Elementary Forms
41360,"but it does not follow that they are imaginary. Quite on the contrary,",Elementary Forms
41360,the mental agitation they cause bears witness to their reality. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,merely one more proof that a very intense social life always does a sort,Elementary Forms
41360,"of violence to the organism, as well as to the individual consciousness,",Elementary Forms
41360,which interferes with its normal functioning. Therefore it can last only,Elementary Forms
41360,a limited length of time.[715],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, if we give the name delirious to every state in which the mind",Elementary Forms
41360,adds to the immediate data given by the senses and projects its own,Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiments and feelings into things, then nearly every collective",Elementary Forms
41360,representation is in a sense delirious; religious beliefs are only one,Elementary Forms
41360,particular case of a very general law. Our whole social environment,Elementary Forms
41360,seems to us to be filled with forces which really exist only in our own,Elementary Forms
41360,"minds. We know what the flag is for the soldier; in itself, it is only a",Elementary Forms
41360,"piece of cloth. Human blood is only an organic liquid, but even to-day",Elementary Forms
41360,we cannot see it flowing without feeling a violent emotion which its,Elementary Forms
41360,physico-chemical properties cannot explain. From the physical point of,Elementary Forms
41360,"view, a man is nothing more than a system of cells, or from the mental",Elementary Forms
41360,"point of view, than a system of representations; in either case, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"differs only in degree from animals. Yet society conceives him, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"obliges us to conceive him, as invested with a character _sui generis_",Elementary Forms
41360,"that isolates him, holds at a distance all rash encroachments and, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"word, imposes respect. This dignity which puts him into a class by",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself appears to us as one of his distinctive attributes, although we",Elementary Forms
41360,can find nothing in the empirical nature of man which justifies it. A,Elementary Forms
41360,cancelled postage stamp may be worth a fortune; but surely this value is,Elementary Forms
41360,"in no way implied in its natural properties. In a sense, our",Elementary Forms
41360,representation of the external world is undoubtedly a mere fabric of,Elementary Forms
41360,"hallucinations, for the odours, tastes and colours that we put into",Elementary Forms
41360,"bodies are not really there, or at least, they are not such as we",Elementary Forms
41360,"perceive them. However, our olfactory, gustatory and visual sensations",Elementary Forms
41360,continue to correspond to certain objective states of the things,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented; they express in their way the properties, either of",Elementary Forms
41360,"material particles or of ether waves, which certainly have their origin",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the bodies which we perceive as fragrant, sapid or coloured. But",Elementary Forms
41360,collective representations very frequently attribute to the things to,Elementary Forms
41360,which they are attached qualities which do not exist under any form or,Elementary Forms
41360,"to any degree. Out of the commonest object, they can make a most",Elementary Forms
41360,powerful sacred being.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yet the powers which are thus conferred, though purely ideal, act as",Elementary Forms
41360,though they were real; they determine the conduct of men with the same,Elementary Forms
41360,degree of necessity as physical forces. The Arunta who has been rubbed,Elementary Forms
41360,with his churinga feels himself stronger; he is stronger. If he has,Elementary Forms
41360,"eaten the flesh of an animal which, though perfectly healthy, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden to him, he will feel himself sick, and may die of it. Surely",Elementary Forms
41360,the soldier who falls while defending his flag does not believe that he,Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifices himself for a bit of cloth. This is all because social,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought, owing to the imperative authority that is in it, has an",Elementary Forms
41360,efficacy that individual thought could never have; by the power which it,Elementary Forms
41360,"has over our minds, it can make us see things in whatever light it",Elementary Forms
41360,pleases; it adds to reality or deducts from it according to the,Elementary Forms
41360,circumstances. Thus there is one division of nature where the formula of,Elementary Forms
41360,idealism is applicable almost to the letter: this is the social kingdom.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Here more than anywhere else, the idea is the reality. Even in this",Elementary Forms
41360,"case, of course, idealism is not true without modification. We can never",Elementary Forms
41360,escape the duality of our nature and free ourselves completely from,Elementary Forms
41360,"physical necessities: in order to express our own ideas to ourselves, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is necessary, as has been shown above, that we fix them upon material",Elementary Forms
41360,things which symbolize them. But here the part of matter is reduced to a,Elementary Forms
41360,minimum. The object serving as support for the idea is not much in,Elementary Forms
41360,"comparison with the ideal superstructure, beneath which it disappears,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and also, it counts for nothing in the superstructure. This is what that",Elementary Forms
41360,"pseudo-delirium consists in, which we find at the bottom of so many",Elementary Forms
41360,collective representations: it is only a form of this essential,Elementary Forms
41360,"idealism.[716] So it is not properly called a delirium, for the ideas",Elementary Forms
41360,"thus objectified are well founded, not in the nature of the material",Elementary Forms
41360,"things upon which they settle themselves, but in the nature of society.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We are now able to understand how the totemic principle, and in",Elementary Forms
41360,"general, every religious force, comes to be outside of the object in",Elementary Forms
41360,which it resides.[717] It is because the idea of it is in no way made up,Elementary Forms
41360,of the impressions directly produced by this thing upon our senses or,Elementary Forms
41360,minds. Religious force is only the sentiment inspired by the group in,Elementary Forms
41360,"its members, but projected outside of the consciousnesses that",Elementary Forms
41360,"experience them, and objectified. To be objectified, they are fixed upon",Elementary Forms
41360,some object which thus becomes sacred; but any object might fulfil this,Elementary Forms
41360,"function. In principle, there are none whose nature predestines them to",Elementary Forms
41360,it to the exclusion of all others; but also there are none that are,Elementary Forms
41360,necessarily impossible.[718] Everything depends upon the circumstances,Elementary Forms
41360,which lead the sentiment creating religious ideas to establish itself,Elementary Forms
41360,"here or there, upon this point or upon that one. Therefore, the sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,character assumed by an object is not implied in the intrinsic,Elementary Forms
41360,properties of this latter: _it is added to them_. The world of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,things is not one particular aspect of empirical nature; _it is,Elementary Forms
41360,superimposed upon it_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This conception of the religious, finally, allows us to explain an",Elementary Forms
41360,important principle found at the bottom of a multitude of myths and,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, and which may be stated thus: when a sacred thing is subdivided,",Elementary Forms
41360,"each of its parts remains equal to the thing itself. In other words, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"far as religious thought is concerned, the part is equal to the whole;",Elementary Forms
41360,"it has the same powers, the same efficacy. The debris of a relic has the",Elementary Forms
41360,same virtue as a relic in good condition. The smallest drop of blood,Elementary Forms
41360,"contains the same active principle as the whole thing. The soul, as we",Elementary Forms
41360,"shall see, may be broken up into nearly as many pieces as there are",Elementary Forms
41360,organs or tissues in the organism; each of these partial souls is worth,Elementary Forms
41360,a whole soul. This conception would be inexplicable if the sacredness of,Elementary Forms
41360,something were due to the constituent properties of the thing itself;,Elementary Forms
41360,"for in that case, it should vary with this thing, increasing and",Elementary Forms
41360,decreasing with it. But if the virtues it is believed to possess are not,Elementary Forms
41360,"intrinsic in it, and if they come from certain sentiments which it",Elementary Forms
41360,"brings to mind and symbolizes, though these originate outside of it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"then, since it has no need of determined dimensions to play this role of",Elementary Forms
41360,"reminder, it will have the same value whether it is entire or not. Since",Elementary Forms
41360,"the part makes us think of the whole, it evokes the same sentiments as",Elementary Forms
41360,the whole. A mere fragment of the flag represents the fatherland just as,Elementary Forms
41360,well as the flag itself: so it is sacred in the same way and to the same,Elementary Forms
41360,degree.[719],Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,V,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if this theory of totemism has enabled us to explain the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristic beliefs of this religion, it rests upon a fact not yet",Elementary Forms
41360,"explained. When the idea of the totem, the emblem of the clan, is given,",Elementary Forms
41360,all the rest follows; but we must still investigate how this idea has,Elementary Forms
41360,been formed. This is a double question and may be subdivided as follows:,Elementary Forms
41360,What has led the clan to choose an emblem? and why have these emblems,Elementary Forms
41360,"been borrowed from the animal and vegetable worlds, and particularly",Elementary Forms
41360,from the former?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,That an emblem is useful as a rallying-centre for any sort of a group it,Elementary Forms
41360,is superfluous to point out. By expressing the social unity in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"material form, it makes this more obvious to all, and for that very",Elementary Forms
41360,reason the use of emblematic symbols must have spread quickly when once,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought of. But more than that, this idea should spontaneously arise out",Elementary Forms
41360,of the conditions of common life; for the emblem is not merely a,Elementary Forms
41360,convenient process for clarifying the sentiment society has of itself:,Elementary Forms
41360,it also serves to create this sentiment; it is one of its constituent,Elementary Forms
41360,elements.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, if left to themselves, individual consciousnesses are closed to",Elementary Forms
41360,each other; they can communicate only by means of signs which express,Elementary Forms
41360,their internal states. If the communication established between them is,Elementary Forms
41360,"to become a real communion, that is to say, a fusion of all particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiments into one common sentiment, the signs expressing them must",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves be fused into one single and unique resultant. It is the,Elementary Forms
41360,appearance of this that informs individuals that they are in harmony and,Elementary Forms
41360,makes them conscious of their moral unity. It is by uttering the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"cry, pronouncing the same word, or performing the same gesture in regard",Elementary Forms
41360,to some object that they become and feel themselves to be in unison. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is true that individual representations also cause reactions in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"organism that are not without importance; however, they can be thought",Elementary Forms
41360,of apart from these physical reactions which accompany them or follow,Elementary Forms
41360,"them, but which do not constitute them. But it is quite another matter",Elementary Forms
41360,with collective representations. They presuppose that minds act and,Elementary Forms
41360,react upon one another; they are the product of these actions and,Elementary Forms
41360,reactions which are themselves possible only through material,Elementary Forms
41360,intermediaries. These latter do not confine themselves to revealing the,Elementary Forms
41360,mental state with which they are associated; they aid in creating it.,Elementary Forms
41360,Individual minds cannot come in contact and communicate with each other,Elementary Forms
41360,except by coming out of themselves; but they cannot do this except by,Elementary Forms
41360,movements. So it is the homogeneity of these movements that gives the,Elementary Forms
41360,group consciousness of itself and consequently makes it exist. When,Elementary Forms
41360,this homogeneity is once established and these movements have once taken,Elementary Forms
41360,"a stereotyped form, they serve to symbolize the corresponding",Elementary Forms
41360,representations. But they symbolize them only because they have aided in,Elementary Forms
41360,forming them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, without symbols, social sentiments could have only a",Elementary Forms
41360,precarious existence. Though very strong as long as men are together and,Elementary Forms
41360,"influence each other reciprocally, they exist only in the form of",Elementary Forms
41360,"recollections after the assembly has ended, and when left to themselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,these become feebler and feebler; for since the group is now no longer,Elementary Forms
41360,"present and active, individual temperaments easily regain the upper",Elementary Forms
41360,hand. The violent passions which may have been released in the heart of,Elementary Forms
41360,"a crowd fall away and are extinguished when this is dissolved, and men",Elementary Forms
41360,ask themselves with astonishment how they could ever have been so,Elementary Forms
41360,carried away from their normal character. But if the movements by which,Elementary Forms
41360,these sentiments are expressed are connected with something that,Elementary Forms
41360,"endures, the sentiments themselves become more durable. These other",Elementary Forms
41360,things are constantly bringing them to mind and arousing them; it is as,Elementary Forms
41360,though the cause which excited them in the first place continued to act.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus these systems of emblems, which are necessary if society is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"become conscious of itself, are no less indispensable for assuring the",Elementary Forms
41360,continuation of this consciousness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So we must refrain from regarding these symbols as simple artifices, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"sorts of labels attached to representations already made, in order to",Elementary Forms
41360,make them more manageable: they are an integral part of them. Even the,Elementary Forms
41360,fact that collective sentiments are thus attached to things completely,Elementary Forms
41360,foreign to them is not purely conventional: it illustrates under a,Elementary Forms
41360,"conventional form a real characteristic of social facts, that is, their",Elementary Forms
41360,"transcendence over individual minds. In fact, it is known that social",Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena are born, not in individuals, but in the group. Whatever part",Elementary Forms
41360,"we may take in their origin, each of us receives them from without.[720]",Elementary Forms
41360,So when we represent them to ourselves as emanating from a material,Elementary Forms
41360,"object, we do not completely misunderstand their nature. Of course they",Elementary Forms
41360,"do not come from the specific thing to which we connect them, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"nevertheless, it is true that their origin is outside of us. If the",Elementary Forms
41360,moral force sustaining the believer does not come from the idol he,Elementary Forms
41360,"adores or the emblem he venerates, still it is from outside of him, as",Elementary Forms
41360,he is well aware. The objectivity of its symbol only translates its,Elementary Forms
41360,externalness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus social life, in all its aspects and in every period of its history,",Elementary Forms
41360,is made possible only by a vast symbolism. The material emblems and,Elementary Forms
41360,figurative representations with which we are more especially concerned,Elementary Forms
41360,"in our present study, are one form of this; but there are many others.",Elementary Forms
41360,Collective sentiments can just as well become incarnate in persons or,Elementary Forms
41360,"formulae: some formulae are flags, while there are persons, either real or",Elementary Forms
41360,"mythical, who are symbols. But there is one sort of emblem which should",Elementary Forms
41360,make an early appearance without reflection or calculation: this is,Elementary Forms
41360,"tattooing. Indeed, well-known facts demonstrate that it is produced",Elementary Forms
41360,almost automatically in certain conditions. When men of an inferior,Elementary Forms
41360,"culture are associated in a common life, they are frequently led, by an",Elementary Forms
41360,"instinctive tendency, as it were, to paint or cut upon the body, images",Elementary Forms
41360,that bear witness to their common existence. According to a text of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Procopius, the early Christians printed on their skin the name of Christ",Elementary Forms
41360,"or the sign of the cross;[721] for a long time, the groups of pilgrims",Elementary Forms
41360,going to Palestine were also tattooed on the arm or wrist with designs,Elementary Forms
41360,representing the cross or the monogram of Christ.[722] This same usage,Elementary Forms
41360,is also reported among the pilgrims going to certain holy places in,Elementary Forms
41360,Italy.[723] A curious case of spontaneous tattooing is given by,Elementary Forms
41360,"Lombroso: twenty young men in an Italian college, when on the point of",Elementary Forms
41360,"separating, decorated themselves with tattoos recording, in various",Elementary Forms
41360,"ways, the years they had spent together.[724] The same fact has",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently been observed among the soldiers in the same barracks, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sailors in the same boat, or the prisoners in the same jail.[725] It",Elementary Forms
41360,"will be understood that especially where methods are still rudimentary,",Elementary Forms
41360,tattooing should be the most direct and expressive means by which the,Elementary Forms
41360,communion of minds can be affirmed. The best way of proving to one's,Elementary Forms
41360,self and to others that one is a member of a certain group is to place a,Elementary Forms
41360,distinctive mark on the body. The proof that this is the reason for the,Elementary Forms
41360,"existence of the totemic image is the fact, which we have already",Elementary Forms
41360,"mentioned, that it does not seek to reproduce the aspect of the thing it",Elementary Forms
41360,is supposed to represent. It is made up of lines and points to which a,Elementary Forms
41360,wholly conventional significance is attributed.[726] Its object is not,Elementary Forms
41360,"to represent or bring to mind a determined object, but to bear witness",Elementary Forms
41360,to the fact that a certain number of individuals participate in the same,Elementary Forms
41360,moral life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the clan is a society which is less able than any other to do",Elementary Forms
41360,"without an emblem or symbol, for there is almost no other so lacking in",Elementary Forms
41360,"consistency. The clan cannot be defined by its chief, for if central",Elementary Forms
41360,"authority is not lacking, it is at least uncertain and unstable.[727]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Nor can it be defined by the territory it occupies, for the population,",Elementary Forms
41360,"being nomad,[728] is not closely attached to any special locality. Also,",Elementary Forms
41360,"owing to the exogamic law, husband and wife must be of different totems;",Elementary Forms
41360,so wherever the totem is transmitted in the maternal line--and this,Elementary Forms
41360,system of filiation is still the most general one[729]--the children are,Elementary Forms
41360,"of a different clan from their father, though living near to him.",Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore we find representatives of a number of different clans in each,Elementary Forms
41360,"family, and still more in each locality. The unity of the group is",Elementary Forms
41360,"visible, therefore, only in the collective name borne by all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"members, and in the equally collective emblem reproducing the object",Elementary Forms
41360,designated by this name. A clan is essentially a reunion of individuals,Elementary Forms
41360,who bear the same name and rally around the same sign. Take away the,Elementary Forms
41360,"name and the sign which materializes it, and the clan is no longer",Elementary Forms
41360,"representable. Since the group is possible only on this condition, both",Elementary Forms
41360,the institution of the emblem and the part it takes in the life of the,Elementary Forms
41360,group are thus explained.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It remains to ask why these names and emblems were taken almost,Elementary Forms
41360,"exclusively from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, but especially from",Elementary Forms
41360,the former.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It seems probable to us that the emblem has played a more important part,Elementary Forms
41360,"than the name. In any case, the written sign still holds a more central",Elementary Forms
41360,place in the life of the clan to-day than does the spoken sign. Now the,Elementary Forms
41360,basis of an emblematic image can be found only in something susceptible,Elementary Forms
41360,"of being represented by a design. On the other hand, these things had to",Elementary Forms
41360,be those with which the men of the clan were the most immediately and,Elementary Forms
41360,habitually coming in contact. Animals fulfilled this condition to a,Elementary Forms
41360,"pre-eminent degree. For these nations of hunters and fishers, the animal",Elementary Forms
41360,constituted an essential element of the economic environment. In this,Elementary Forms
41360,connection plants had only a secondary place for they can hold only a,Elementary Forms
41360,"secondary place as food as long as they are not cultivated. Moreover,",Elementary Forms
41360,the animal is more closely associated with the life of men than the,Elementary Forms
41360,"plant is, if only because of the natural kinship uniting these two to",Elementary Forms
41360,"each other. On the other hand, the sun, moon and stars are too far away,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they give the effect of belonging to another world.[730] Also, as long",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the constellations were not distinguished and classified, the starry",Elementary Forms
41360,vault did not offer a sufficient diversity of clearly differentiated,Elementary Forms
41360,"things to be able to mark all the clans and sub-clans of a tribe; but,",Elementary Forms
41360,"on the contrary, the variety of the flora, and especially of the fauna,",Elementary Forms
41360,"was almost inexhaustible. Therefore celestial bodies, in spite of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"brilliancy and the sharp impression they make upon the senses, were",Elementary Forms
41360,"unfitted for the role of totems, while animals and plants seemed",Elementary Forms
41360,predestined to it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Ah observation of Strehlow even allows us to state precisely the way in,Elementary Forms
41360,which these emblems were probably chosen. He says that he has noticed,Elementary Forms
41360,"that the totemic centres are generally situated near a mountain, spring",Elementary Forms
41360,or gorge where the animals serving as totems to the group gather in,Elementary Forms
41360,"abundance, and he cites a certain number of examples of this fact.[731]",Elementary Forms
41360,Now these totemic centres are surely the consecrated places where the,Elementary Forms
41360,meetings of the clan are held. So it seems as though each group had,Elementary Forms
41360,taken as its insignia the animal or plant that was the commonest in the,Elementary Forms
41360,vicinity of the place where it had the habit of meeting.[732],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,VI,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This conception of totemism will give us the explanation of a very,Elementary Forms
41360,"curious trait of human mentality which, even though more marked formerly",Elementary Forms
41360,"than to-day, has not yet disappeared and which, in any case, has been of",Elementary Forms
41360,considerable importance in the history of human thought. It will furnish,Elementary Forms
41360,still another occasion for showing how logical evolution is closely,Elementary Forms
41360,"connected with religious evolution and how it, like this latter, depends",Elementary Forms
41360,upon social conditions.[733],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If there is one truth which appears to be absolutely certain to-day, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is that beings differing not only in their outward appearance but also,Elementary Forms
41360,"in their most essential properties, such as minerals, plants, animals",Elementary Forms
41360,"and men, cannot be considered equivalent and interchangeable. Long",Elementary Forms
41360,"usage, which scientific culture has still more firmly embedded in our",Elementary Forms
41360,"minds, has taught us to establish barriers between the kingdoms, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,existence transformism itself does not deny; for though this admits that,Elementary Forms
41360,"life may have arisen from non-living matter and men from animals, still,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it does not fail to recognize the fact that living beings, once formed,",Elementary Forms
41360,"are different from minerals, and men different from animals. Within each",Elementary Forms
41360,kingdom the same barriers separate the different classes: we cannot,Elementary Forms
41360,conceive of one mineral having the same distinctive characteristics as,Elementary Forms
41360,"another, or of one animal species having those of another species. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"these distinctions, which seem so natural to us, are in no way",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive. In the beginning, all the kingdoms are confounded with each",Elementary Forms
41360,"other. Rocks have a sex; they have the power of begetting; the sun, moon",Elementary Forms
41360,"and stars are men or women who feel and express human sentiments, while",Elementary Forms
41360,"men, on the contrary, are thought of as animals or plants. This state of",Elementary Forms
41360,confusion is found at the basis of all mythologies. Hence comes the,Elementary Forms
41360,ambiguous character of the beings portrayed in the mythologies; they can,Elementary Forms
41360,"be classified in no definite group, for they participate at the same",Elementary Forms
41360,time in the most opposed groups. It is also readily admitted that they,Elementary Forms
41360,can go from one into another; and for a long time men believed that they,Elementary Forms
41360,were able to explain the origin of things by these transmutations.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"That the anthropomorphic instinct, with which the animists have endowed",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive men, cannot explain their mental condition is shown by the",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of the confusions of which they are guilty. In fact, these do not",Elementary Forms
41360,come from the fact that men have immoderately extended the human kingdom,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the point of making all the others enter into it, but from the fact",Elementary Forms
41360,that they confound the most disparate kingdoms. They have not conceived,Elementary Forms
41360,the world in their own image any more than they have conceived,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves in the world's image: they have done both at the same time.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Into the idea they have formed of things, they have undoubtedly made",Elementary Forms
41360,"human elements enter; but into the idea they have formed of themselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,they have made enter elements coming from things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Yet there is nothing in experience which could suggest these connections,Elementary Forms
41360,"and confusions. As far as the observation of the senses is able to go,",Elementary Forms
41360,everything is different and disconnected. Nowhere do we really see,Elementary Forms
41360,beings mixing their natures and metamorphosing themselves into each,Elementary Forms
41360,other. It is therefore necessary that some exceptionally powerful cause,Elementary Forms
41360,should have intervened to transfigure reality in such a way as to make,Elementary Forms
41360,it appear under an aspect that is not really its own.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is religion that was the agent of this transfiguration; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious beliefs that have substituted for the world, as it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"perceived by the senses, another different one. This is well shown by",Elementary Forms
41360,the case of totemism. The fundamental thing in this religion is that the,Elementary Forms
41360,men of the clan and the different beings whose form the totemic emblems,Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce pass as being made of the same essence. Now when this belief,Elementary Forms
41360,"was once admitted, the bridge between the different kingdoms was already",Elementary Forms
41360,built. The man was represented as a sort of animal or plant; the plants,Elementary Forms
41360,"and animals were thought of as the relatives of men, or rather, all",Elementary Forms
41360,"these beings, so different for the senses, were thought of as",Elementary Forms
41360,participating in a single nature. So this remarkable aptitude for,Elementary Forms
41360,confusing things that seem to be obviously distinct comes from the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,that the first forces with which the human intellect has peopled the,Elementary Forms
41360,world were elaborated by religion. Since these were made up of elements,Elementary Forms
41360,"taken from the different kingdoms, men conceived a principle common to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the most heterogeneous things, which thus became endowed with a sole and",Elementary Forms
41360,single essence.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we also know that these religious conceptions are the result of,Elementary Forms
41360,determined social causes. Since the clan cannot exist without a name and,Elementary Forms
41360,"an emblem, and since this emblem is always before the eyes of men, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon this, and the objects whose image it is, that the sentiments which",Elementary Forms
41360,society arouses in its members are fixed. Men were thus compelled to,Elementary Forms
41360,"represent the collective force, whose action they felt, in the form of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the thing serving as flag to the group. Therefore, in the idea of this",Elementary Forms
41360,"force were mixed up the most different kingdoms; in one sense, it was",Elementary Forms
41360,"essentially human, since it was made up of human ideas and sentiments;",Elementary Forms
41360,"but at the same time, it could not fail to appear as closely related to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animate or inanimate beings who gave it its outward form. Moreover,",Elementary Forms
41360,the cause whose action we observe here is not peculiar to totemism;,Elementary Forms
41360,"there is no society where it is not active. In a general way, a",Elementary Forms
41360,collective sentiment can become conscious of itself only by being fixed,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon some material object;[734] but by this very fact, it participates",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the nature of this object, and reciprocally, the object participates",Elementary Forms
41360,in its nature. So it was social necessity which brought about the fusion,Elementary Forms
41360,"of notions appearing distinct at first, and social life has facilitated",Elementary Forms
41360,this fusion by the great mental effervescences it determines.[735] This,Elementary Forms
41360,"is one more proof that logical understanding is a function of society,",Elementary Forms
41360,for it takes the forms and attitudes that this latter presses upon it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that this logic is disconcerting for us. Yet we must be,Elementary Forms
41360,"careful not to depreciate it: howsoever crude it may appear to us, it",Elementary Forms
41360,has been an aid of the greatest importance in the intellectual evolution,Elementary Forms
41360,"of humanity. In fact, it is through it that the first explanation of the",Elementary Forms
41360,world has been made possible. Of course the mental habits it implies,Elementary Forms
41360,prevented men from seeing reality as their senses show it to them; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"as they show it, it has the grave inconvenience of allowing of no",Elementary Forms
41360,explanation. For to explain is to attach things to each other and to,Elementary Forms
41360,establish relations between them which make them appear to us as,Elementary Forms
41360,functions of each other and as vibrating sympathetically according to an,Elementary Forms
41360,"internal law founded in their nature. But sensations, which see nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,"except from the outside, could never make them disclose these relations",Elementary Forms
41360,and internal bonds; the intellect alone can create the notion of them.,Elementary Forms
41360,"When I learn that A regularly precedes B, my knowledge is increased by a",Elementary Forms
41360,new fact; but my intelligence is not at all satisfied with a statement,Elementary Forms
41360,which does not show its reason. I commence to _understand_ only if it is,Elementary Forms
41360,possible for me to conceive B in a way that makes it appear to me as,Elementary Forms
41360,"something that is not foreign to A, and as united to A by some relation",Elementary Forms
41360,of kinship. The great service that religions have rendered to thought is,Elementary Forms
41360,that they have constructed a first representation of what these,Elementary Forms
41360,relations of kinship between things may be. In the circumstances under,Elementary Forms
41360,"which it was attempted, the enterprise could obviously attain only",Elementary Forms
41360,"precarious results. But then, does it ever attain any that are definite,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and is it not always necessary to reconsider them? And also, it is less",Elementary Forms
41360,important to succeed than to try. The essential thing was not to leave,Elementary Forms
41360,"the mind enslaved to visible appearances, but to teach it to dominate",Elementary Forms
41360,them and to connect what the senses separated; for from the moment when,Elementary Forms
41360,"men have an idea that there are internal connections between things,",Elementary Forms
41360,science and philosophy become possible. Religion opened up the way for,Elementary Forms
41360,"them. But if it has been able to play this part, it is only because it",Elementary Forms
41360,is a social affair. In order to make a law for the impressions of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"senses and to substitute a new way of representing reality for them,",Elementary Forms
41360,thought of a new sort had to be founded: this is collective thought. If,Elementary Forms
41360,"this alone has had this efficacy, it is because of the fact that to",Elementary Forms
41360,create a world of ideals through which the world of experienced,Elementary Forms
41360,"realities would appear transfigured, a super-excitation of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"intellectual forces was necessary, which is possible only in and through",Elementary Forms
41360,society.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So it is far from true that this mentality has no connection with ours.,Elementary Forms
41360,Our logic was born of this logic. The explanations of contemporary,Elementary Forms
41360,science are surer of being objective because they are more methodical,Elementary Forms
41360,"and because they rest on more carefully controlled observations, but",Elementary Forms
41360,they do not differ in nature from those which satisfy primitive thought.,Elementary Forms
41360,"To-day, as formerly, to explain is to show how one thing participates in",Elementary Forms
41360,one or several others. It has been said that the participations of this,Elementary Forms
41360,sort implied by the mythologies violate the principle of contradiction,Elementary Forms
41360,and that they are by that opposed to those implied by scientific,Elementary Forms
41360,explanations.[736] Is not the statement that a man is a kangaroo or the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sun a bird, equal to identifying the two with each other? But our manner",Elementary Forms
41360,"of thought is not different when we say of heat that it is a movement,",Elementary Forms
41360,"or of light that it is a vibration of the ether, etc. Every time that we",Elementary Forms
41360,"unite heterogeneous terms by an internal bond, we forcibly identify",Elementary Forms
41360,contraries. Of course the terms we unite are not those which the,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian brings together; we choose them according to different,Elementary Forms
41360,criteria and for different reasons; but the processes by which the mind,Elementary Forms
41360,puts them in connection do not differ essentially.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that if primitive thought had that sort of general and,Elementary Forms
41360,systematic indifference to contradictions which has been attributed to,Elementary Forms
41360,"it,[737] it would be in open contradiction on this point with modern",Elementary Forms
41360,"thought, which is always careful to remain consistent with itself. But",Elementary Forms
41360,we do not believe that it is possible to characterize the mentality of,Elementary Forms
41360,inferior societies by a single and exclusive inclination for,Elementary Forms
41360,"indistinction. If the primitive confounds things which we distinguish,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he also distinguishes things which we connect together, and he even",Elementary Forms
41360,conceives these distinctions in the form of sharp and clear-cut,Elementary Forms
41360,oppositions. Between two things which are classified in two different,Elementary Forms
41360,"phratries, there is not only separation, but even antagonism.[738] For",Elementary Forms
41360,"this reason, the same Australian who confounds the sun and the white",Elementary Forms
41360,"cockatoo, opposes this latter to the black cockatoo as to its contrary.",Elementary Forms
41360,The two seem to him to belong to two separate classes between which,Elementary Forms
41360,there is nothing in common. A still more marked opposition is that,Elementary Forms
41360,existing between sacred things and profane things. They repel and,Elementary Forms
41360,contradict each other with so much force that the mind refuses to think,Elementary Forms
41360,of them at the same time. They mutually expel each other from the,Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus between the logic of religious thought and that of scientific,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought there is no abyss. The two are made up of the same elements,",Elementary Forms
41360,though inequally and differently developed. The special characteristic,Elementary Forms
41360,of the former seems to be its natural taste for immoderate confusions as,Elementary Forms
41360,well as sharp contrasts. It is voluntarily excessive in each direction.,Elementary Forms
41360,"When it connects, it confounds; when it distinguishes, it opposes. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"knows no shades and measures, it seeks extremes; it consequently employs",Elementary Forms
41360,"logical mechanisms with a certain awkwardness, but it ignores none of",Elementary Forms
41360,them.,Elementary Forms

41360,THE IDEA OF THE SOUL,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In the preceding chapters we have been studying the fundamental,Elementary Forms
41360,principles of the totemic religion. We have seen that no idea of soul or,Elementary Forms
41360,"spirit or mythical personality is to be found among these. Yet, even if",Elementary Forms
41360,"the idea of spiritual beings is not at the foundation of totemism or,",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently, of religious thought in general, still, there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,religion where this notion is not met with. So it is important to see,Elementary Forms
41360,how it is formed. To make sure that it is the product of a secondary,Elementary Forms
41360,"formation, we must discover the way in which it is derived from the more",Elementary Forms
41360,essential conceptions which we have just described and explained.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the various spiritual beings, there is one which should receive",Elementary Forms
41360,our attention first of all because it is the prototype after which the,Elementary Forms
41360,others have been constructed: this is the soul.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Just as there is no known society without a religion, so there exist",Elementary Forms
41360,"none, howsoever crudely organized they may be, where we do not find a",Elementary Forms
41360,"whole system of collective representations concerning the soul, its",Elementary Forms
41360,origin and its destiny. So far as we are able to judge from the data of,Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnology, the idea of the soul seems to have been contemporaneous with",Elementary Forms
41360,"humanity itself, and it seems to have had all of its essential",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics so well formulated at the very outset that the work of,Elementary Forms
41360,the more advanced religions and philosophy has been practically confined,Elementary Forms
41360,"to refining it, while adding nothing that is really fundamental. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, all the Australian societies admit that every human body shelters",Elementary Forms
41360,"an interior being, the principle of the life which animates it: this is",Elementary Forms
41360,"the soul. It sometimes happens, it is true, that women form an exception",Elementary Forms
41360,to this general rule: there are tribes where they are believed to have,Elementary Forms
41360,"no souls.[739] If Dawson is to be believed, it is the same with young",Elementary Forms
41360,children in the tribes that he has observed.[740] But these are,Elementary Forms
41360,exceptional and probably late cases;[741] the last one even seems to be,Elementary Forms
41360,suspect and may well be due to an erroneous interpretation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,facts.[742],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is not easy to determine the idea which the Australian makes of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"soul, because it is so obscure and floating; but we should not be",Elementary Forms
41360,"surprised at this. If someone asked our own contemporaries, or even",Elementary Forms
41360,"those of them who believe most firmly in the existence of the soul, how",Elementary Forms
41360,"they represented it, the replies that he would receive would not have",Elementary Forms
41360,much more coherence and precision. This is because we are dealing with a,Elementary Forms
41360,"very complex notion, into which a multitude of badly analysed",Elementary Forms
41360,"impressions enter, whose elaboration has been carried on for centuries,",Elementary Forms
41360,though men have had no clear consciousness of it. Yet from this come the,Elementary Forms
41360,"most essential, though frequently contradictory, characteristics by",Elementary Forms
41360,which it is defined.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In some cases they tell us that it has the external appearance of the,Elementary Forms
41360,body.[743] But sometimes it is also represented as having the size of a,Elementary Forms
41360,grain of sand; its dimensions are so reduced that it can pass through,Elementary Forms
41360,the smallest crevices or the finest tissues.[744] We shall also see that,Elementary Forms
41360,it is represented in the appearance of animals. This shows that its form,Elementary Forms
41360,is essentially inconsistent and undetermined;[745] it varies from one,Elementary Forms
41360,moment to another with the demands of circumstances or according to the,Elementary Forms
41360,exigencies of the myth and the rite. The substance out of which it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"made is no less indefinable. It is not without matter, for it has a",Elementary Forms
41360,"form, howsoever vague this may be. And in fact, even during this life,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it has physical needs: it eats, and inversely, it may be eaten.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Sometimes it leaves the body, and in the course of its travels it",Elementary Forms
41360,occasionally nourishes itself on foreign souls.[746] After it has once,Elementary Forms
41360,"been completely freed from the organism, it is thought to lead a life",Elementary Forms
41360,"absolutely analogous to the one it led in this world; it eats, drinks,",Elementary Forms
41360,"hunts, etc.[747] When it flutters among the branches of trees, it causes",Elementary Forms
41360,rustlings and crackings which even profane ears hear.[748] But at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, it is believed to be invisible to the vulgar.[749] It is true",Elementary Forms
41360,that magicians or old men have the faculty of seeing souls; but it is in,Elementary Forms
41360,virtue of special powers which they owe either to age or to a special,Elementary Forms
41360,training that they perceive things which escape our senses. According to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Dawson, ordinary individuals enjoy the same privilege at only one moment",Elementary Forms
41360,of their existence: when they are on the eve of a premature death.,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore this quasi-miraculous vision is considered a sinister omen.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now, invisibility is generally considered one of the signs of",Elementary Forms
41360,spirituality. So the soul is conceived as being immaterial to a certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"degree, for it does not affect the senses in the way bodies do: it has",Elementary Forms
41360,"no bones, as the tribes of the Tully River say.[750] In order to",Elementary Forms
41360,"conciliate all these opposed characteristics, they represent it as made",Elementary Forms
41360,"of some infinitely rare and subtle matter, like something ethereal,[751]",Elementary Forms
41360,and comparable to a shadow or breath.[752],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is distinct and independent of the body, for during this life it can",Elementary Forms
41360,"leave it at any moment. It does leave it during sleep, fainting spells,",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.[753] It may even remain absent for some time without entailing,Elementary Forms
41360,"death; however, during these absences life is weakened and even stops if",Elementary Forms
41360,the soul does not return home.[754] But it is especially at death that,Elementary Forms
41360,this distinction and independence manifest themselves with the greatest,Elementary Forms
41360,clarity. While the body no longer exists and no visible traces of it,Elementary Forms
41360,"remain, the soul continues to live: it leads an autonomous existence in",Elementary Forms
41360,another world.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But howsoever real this duality may be, it is in no way absolute. It",Elementary Forms
41360,would show a grave misunderstanding to represent the body as a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,"habitat in which the soul resides, but with which it has only external",Elementary Forms
41360,"relations. Quite on the contrary, it is united to it by the closest",Elementary Forms
41360,bonds; it is separable from it only imperfectly and with difficulty. We,Elementary Forms
41360,"have already seen that it has, or at least is able to have, its external",Elementary Forms
41360,"aspect. Consequently, everything that hurts the one hurts the other;",Elementary Forms
41360,every wound of the body spreads to the soul.[755] It is so intimately,Elementary Forms
41360,associated with the life of the organism that it grows with it and,Elementary Forms
41360,decays with it. This is why a man who has attained a certain age enjoys,Elementary Forms
41360,privileges refused to young men; it is because the religious principle,Elementary Forms
41360,within him has acquired greater force and efficacy as he has advanced in,Elementary Forms
41360,"life. But when senility sets in, and the old man is no longer able to",Elementary Forms
41360,take a useful part in the great religious ceremonies in which the vital,Elementary Forms
41360,"interests of the tribe are concerned, this respect is no longer accorded",Elementary Forms
41360,to him. It is thought that weakness of the body is communicated to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"soul. Having the same powers no longer, he no longer has a right to the",Elementary Forms
41360,same prestige.[756],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"There is not only a close union of soul and body, but there is also a",Elementary Forms
41360,partial confusion of the two. Just as there is something of the body in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the soul, since it sometimes reproduces its form, so there is something",Elementary Forms
41360,of the soul in the body. Certain regions and certain products of the,Elementary Forms
41360,organism are believed to have a special affinity with it: such is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"case with the heart, the breath, the placenta,[757] the blood,[758] the",Elementary Forms
41360,"shadow,[759] the liver, the fat of the liver, the kidneys,[760] etc.",Elementary Forms
41360,These various material substrata are not mere habitations of the soul;,Elementary Forms
41360,"they are the soul itself seen from without. When blood flows, the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,escapes with it. The soul is not in the breath; it is the breath. It and,Elementary Forms
41360,the part of the body where it resides are only one. Hence comes the,Elementary Forms
41360,conception according to which a man has a number of souls. Being,Elementary Forms
41360,"dispersed in various parts of the organism, the soul is differentiated",Elementary Forms
41360,"and broken up into fragments. Each organ has individualized, as it were,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the portion of the soul which it contains, and which has thus become a",Elementary Forms
41360,distinct entity. The soul of the heart could not be that of the breath,Elementary Forms
41360,"or the shadow or the placenta. While they are all related, still they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are to be distinguished, and even have different names.[761]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, even if the soul is localized especially in certain parts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the organism, it is not absent from the others. In varying degrees, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is diffused through the whole body, as is well shown by the funeral",Elementary Forms
41360,rites. After the last breath has been expired and the soul is believed,Elementary Forms
41360,"to be gone, it seems as though it should profit by the liberty thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"regained, to move about at will and to return as quickly as possible to",Elementary Forms
41360,"its real home, which is elsewhere. Nevertheless, it remains near to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"corpse; the bond uniting them has been loosened, but not broken. A whole",Elementary Forms
41360,series of special rites are necessary to induce it to depart definitely.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is invited to go by gestures and significant movements.[762] The way,Elementary Forms
41360,"is laid open for it, and outlets are arranged so that it can go more",Elementary Forms
41360,easily.[763] This is because it has not left the body entirely; it was,Elementary Forms
41360,too closely united to it to break away all at once. Hence comes the very,Elementary Forms
41360,frequent rite of funeral anthropophagy; the flesh of the dead is eaten,Elementary Forms
41360,"because it is thought to contain a sacred principle, which is really",Elementary Forms
41360,"nothing more than the soul.[764] In order to drive it out definitely,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the flesh is melted, either by submitting it to the heat of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sun,[765] or to that of an artificial fire.[766] The soul departs with",Elementary Forms
41360,the liquids which result. But even the dry bones still retain some part,Elementary Forms
41360,of it. Therefore they can be used as sacred objects or instruments of,Elementary Forms
41360,magic;[767] or if someone wishes to give complete liberty to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle which they contain, he breaks these.[768]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But a moment does arrive when the final separation is accomplished; the,Elementary Forms
41360,liberated soul takes flight. But by nature it is so intimately,Elementary Forms
41360,associated with the body that this removal cannot take place without a,Elementary Forms
41360,profound change in its condition. So it takes a new name also.[769],Elementary Forms
41360,Although keeping all the distinctive traits of the individual whom it,Elementary Forms
41360,"animated, his humours and his good and bad qualities,[770] still it has",Elementary Forms
41360,become a new being. From that moment a new existence commences for it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It goes to the land of souls. This land is conceived differently by,Elementary Forms
41360,different tribes; sometimes different conceptions are found existing,Elementary Forms
41360,"side by side in the same society. For some, it is situated under the",Elementary Forms
41360,"earth, where each totemic group has its part. This is at the spot where",Elementary Forms
41360,"the first ancestors, the founders of the clan, entered the ground at a",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain time, and where they live since their death. In the subterranean",Elementary Forms
41360,world there is a geographical disposition of the dead corresponding to,Elementary Forms
41360,"that of the living. There, the sun always shines and rivers flow which",Elementary Forms
41360,never run dry. Such is the conception which Spencer and Gillen attribute,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the central tribes, Arunta,[771] Warramunga,[772] etc. It is found",Elementary Forms
41360,"again among the Wotjobaluk.[773] In other places, all the dead, no",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter what their totems may have been, are believed to live together in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same place, which is more or less vaguely localized as beyond the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sea, in an island,[774] or on the shores of a lake.[775] Sometimes,",Elementary Forms
41360,"finally, it is into the sky, beyond the clouds, that the souls are",Elementary Forms
41360,"thought to go. ""There,"" says Dawson, ""there is a delectable land,",Elementary Forms
41360,"abounding in kangaroos and game of every sort, where men lead a happy",Elementary Forms
41360,"life. Souls meet again there and recognize one another.""[776] It is",Elementary Forms
41360,probable that certain of the features of this picture have been taken,Elementary Forms
41360,from the paradise of the Christian missionaries;[777] but the idea that,Elementary Forms
41360,"souls, or at least some souls, enter the skies after death appears to be",Elementary Forms
41360,quite indigenous; for it is found again in other parts of the,Elementary Forms
41360,continent.[778],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In general, all the souls meet the same fate and lead the same life.",Elementary Forms
41360,"However, a different treatment is sometimes accorded them based on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"way they have conducted themselves upon earth, and we can see the first",Elementary Forms
41360,outlines of these two distinct and even opposed compartments into which,Elementary Forms
41360,the world to come will later be divided. The souls of those who have,Elementary Forms
41360,"excelled, during life, as hunters, warriors, dancers, etc., are not",Elementary Forms
41360,confounded with the common horde of the others; a special place is,Elementary Forms
41360,"granted to them.[779] Sometimes, this is the sky.[780] Strehlow even",Elementary Forms
41360,"says that according to one myth, the souls of the wicked are devoured by",Elementary Forms
41360,"dreadful spirits, and destroyed.[781] Nevertheless, these conceptions",Elementary Forms
41360,always remain very vague in Australia;[782] they begin to have a clarity,Elementary Forms
41360,"and determination only in the more advanced societies, such as those of",Elementary Forms
41360,America.[783],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Such are the beliefs relative to the soul and its destiny, in their most",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitive form, and reduced to their most essential traits. We must now",Elementary Forms
41360,attempt to explain them. What is it that has been able to lead men into,Elementary Forms
41360,"thinking that there are two beings in them, one of which possesses these",Elementary Forms
41360,very special characteristics which we have just enumerated? To find the,Elementary Forms
41360,"reply to this question, let us begin by seeking the origin attributed to",Elementary Forms
41360,this spiritual principle by the primitive himself: if it is well,Elementary Forms
41360,"analysed, his own conception will put us on the way towards the",Elementary Forms
41360,solution.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Following out the method which we have set before ourselves, we shall",Elementary Forms
41360,study these ideas in a determined group of societies where they have,Elementary Forms
41360,been observed with an especial precision; these are the tribes of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Central Australia. Though not narrow, the area of our observations will",Elementary Forms
41360,be limited. But there is good reason for believing that these same ideas,Elementary Forms
41360,"are quite generally held, in various forms, even outside of Australia.",Elementary Forms
41360,"It is also to be noted that the idea of the soul, as it is found among",Elementary Forms
41360,"these central tribes, does not differ specifically from the one found in",Elementary Forms
41360,other tribes; it has the same essential characteristics everywhere. As,Elementary Forms
41360,"one effect always has the same cause, we may well think that this idea,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is everywhere the same, does not result from one cause here and",Elementary Forms
41360,another there. So the origin which we shall be led to attribute to it as,Elementary Forms
41360,a result of our study of these particular tribes with which we are going,Elementary Forms
41360,"to deal, ought to be equally true for the others. These tribes will give",Elementary Forms
41360,"us a chance to make an experiment, as it were, whose results, like those",Elementary Forms
41360,"of every well-made experiment, are susceptible of generalization. The",Elementary Forms
41360,homogeneity of the Australian civilization would of itself be enough to,Elementary Forms
41360,justify this generalization; but we shall be careful to verify it,Elementary Forms
41360,"afterwards with facts taken from other peoples, both in Australia and",Elementary Forms
41360,America.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,As the conceptions which are going to furnish us with the basis of our,Elementary Forms
41360,demonstration have been reported in different terms by Spencer and,Elementary Forms
41360,"Gillen on the one hand and Strehlow on the other, we must give these two",Elementary Forms
41360,versions one after the other. We shall see that when they are well,Elementary Forms
41360,"understood, they differ in form more than in matter, and that they both",Elementary Forms
41360,have the same sociological significance.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to Spencer and Gillen, the souls which, in each generation,",Elementary Forms
41360,"come to animate the bodies of newly-born children, are not special and",Elementary Forms
41360,original creations; all these tribes hold that there is a definite stock,Elementary Forms
41360,"of souls, whose number cannot be augmented at all,[784] and which",Elementary Forms
41360,"reincarnate themselves periodically. When an individual dies, his soul",Elementary Forms
41360,"quits the body in which it dwelt, and after the mourning is",Elementary Forms
41360,"accomplished, it goes to the land of the souls; but after a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"length of time, it returns to incarnate itself again, and these",Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnations are the cause of conception and birth. At the beginning,Elementary Forms
41360,"of things, it was these fundamental souls which animated the first",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestors, the founders of the clan. At an epoch, beyond which the",Elementary Forms
41360,imagination does not go and which is considered the very beginning of,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, there were certain beings who were not derived from any others.",Elementary Forms
41360,"For this reason, the Arunta call them the _Altjirangamitjina_,[785] the",Elementary Forms
41360,"uncreated ones, those who exist from all eternity, and, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen, they give the name _Alcheringa_[786] to the period",Elementary Forms
41360,when these fabulous beings are thought to have lived. Being organized in,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic clans just as the men of to-day are, they passed their time in",Elementary Forms
41360,"travels, in the course of which they accomplished all sorts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"prodigious actions, the memory of which is preserved in the myths. But a",Elementary Forms
41360,moment arrived when this terrestrial life came to a close; singly or in,Elementary Forms
41360,"groups, they entered into the earth. But their souls live for ever; they",Elementary Forms
41360,are immortal. They even continue to frequent the places where the,Elementary Forms
41360,"existence of their former hosts came to an end. Moreover, owing to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"memories attached to them, these places have a sacred character; it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"here that the oknanikilla are located, the sorts of sanctuaries where",Elementary Forms
41360,"the churinga of the clan is kept, and the centres of the different",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic cults. When one of the souls which wander about these,Elementary Forms
41360,"sanctuaries enters into the body of a woman, the result is a conception",Elementary Forms
41360,and later a birth.[787] So each individual is considered as a new,Elementary Forms
41360,"appearance of a determined ancestor: it is this ancestor himself, come",Elementary Forms
41360,"back in a new body and with new features. Now, what were these",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestors?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, they were endowed with powers infinitely superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,"those possessed by men to-day, even the most respected old men and the",Elementary Forms
41360,most celebrated magicians. They are attributed virtues which we may,Elementary Forms
41360,"speak of as miraculous: ""They could travel on, or above, or beneath the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ground; by opening a vein in the arm, each of them could flood whole",Elementary Forms
41360,tracts of country or cause level plains to arise; in rocky ranges they,Elementary Forms
41360,"could make pools of water spring into existence, or could make deep",Elementary Forms
41360,"gorges and gaps through which to traverse the ranges, and where they",Elementary Forms
41360,"planted their sacred poles (nurtunja), there rocks or trees arose to",Elementary Forms
41360,"mark the spot.""[788] It is they who gave the earth the form it has at",Elementary Forms
41360,"present. They created all sorts of beings, both men and animals. They",Elementary Forms
41360,are nearly gods. So their souls also have a divine character. And since,Elementary Forms
41360,the souls of men are these ancestral souls reincarnated in the human,Elementary Forms
41360,"body, these are sacred beings too.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the second place, these ancestors were not men in the proper sense of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the word, but animals or vegetables, or perhaps mixed beings in which",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal or vegetable element predominated: ""In the Alcheringa,"" say",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen, ""lived ancestors who, in the native mind, are so",Elementary Forms
41360,intimately associated with the animals or plants the name of which they,Elementary Forms
41360,"bear that an Alcheringa man of, say, the kangaroo totem may sometimes be",Elementary Forms
41360,spoken of either as a man-kangaroo or a kangaroo-man. The identity of,Elementary Forms
41360,the human individual is often sunk in that of the animal or plant from,Elementary Forms
41360,"which he is supposed to have originated.""[789] Their immortal souls",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessarily have the same nature; in them, also, the human element is",Elementary Forms
41360,"wedded to the animal element, with a certain tendency for the latter to",Elementary Forms
41360,predominate over the former. So they are made of the same substance as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic principle, for we know that the special characteristic of",Elementary Forms
41360,"this is to present this double nature, and to synthesize and confound",Elementary Forms
41360,the two realms in itself.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Since no other souls than these exist, we reach the conclusion that, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"a general way, the soul is nothing other than the totemic principle",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnate in each individual. And there is nothing to surprise us in,Elementary Forms
41360,this derivation. We already know that this principle is immanent in each,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the members of the clan. But in penetrating into these individuals,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it must inevitably individualize itself. Because the consciousnesses, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it becomes thus an integral part, differ from each other, it",Elementary Forms
41360,differentiates itself according to their image; since each has its own,Elementary Forms
41360,"physiognomy, it takes a distinct physiognomy in each. Of course it",Elementary Forms
41360,"remains something outside of and foreign to the man, but the portion of",Elementary Forms
41360,it which each is believed to possess cannot fail to contract close,Elementary Forms
41360,affinities with the particular subject in which it resides; it becomes,Elementary Forms
41360,"his to a certain extent. Thus it has two contradictory characteristics,",Elementary Forms
41360,but whose coexistence is one of the distinctive features of the notion,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the soul. To-day, as formerly, the soul is what is best and most",Elementary Forms
41360,"profound in ourselves, and the pre-eminent part of our being; yet it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"also a passing guest which comes from the outside, which leads in us an",Elementary Forms
41360,"existence distinct from that of the body, and which should one day",Elementary Forms
41360,"regain its entire independence. In a word, just as society exists only",Elementary Forms
41360,"in and through individuals, the totemic principle exists only in and",Elementary Forms
41360,through the individual consciousnesses whose association forms the clan.,Elementary Forms
41360,If they did not feel it in them it would not exist; it is they who put,Elementary Forms
41360,it into things. So it must of necessity be divided and distributed among,Elementary Forms
41360,them. Each of these fragments is a soul.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A myth which is found in a rather large number of the societies of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"centre, and which, moreover, is only a particular form of the preceding",Elementary Forms
41360,"ones, shows even better that this is really the matter out of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of the soul is made. In these tribes, tradition puts the origin of",Elementary Forms
41360,"each clan, not in a number of ancestors, but in only two,[790] or even",Elementary Forms
41360,"in one.[791] This unique being, as long as he remained single, contained",Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic principle within him integrally, for at this moment there",Elementary Forms
41360,"was nothing to which this principle could be communicated. Now,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to this same tradition, all the human souls which exist, both",Elementary Forms
41360,those which now animate the bodies of men and those which are at present,Elementary Forms
41360,"unemployed, being held in reserve for the future, have issued from this",Elementary Forms
41360,unique personage; they are made of his substance. While travelling over,Elementary Forms
41360,"the surface of the ground, or moving about, or shaking himself, he made",Elementary Forms
41360,them leave his body and planted them in the various places he is,Elementary Forms
41360,believed to have passed over. Is this not merely a symbolic way of,Elementary Forms
41360,saying that they are parts of the totemic divinity?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this conclusion presupposes that the tribes of which we have just,Elementary Forms
41360,been speaking admit the doctrine of reincarnation. Now according to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow, this doctrine is unknown to the Arunta, the society which",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen have studied the longest and the best. If, in this",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular case, these two observers have misunderstood things to such",Elementary Forms
41360,"an extent, their whole testimony would become suspect. So it is",Elementary Forms
41360,important to determine the actual extent of this divergence.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to Strehlow, after the soul has once been definitely freed",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the body by the rites of mourning, it never reincarnates itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"again. It goes off to the isles of the dead, where it passes its days in",Elementary Forms
41360,"sleeping and its nights in dancing, until it returns again to earth.",Elementary Forms
41360,Then it comes back into the midst of the living and plays the role of,Elementary Forms
41360,"protecting genius to the young sons, or if such are lacking, to the",Elementary Forms
41360,grandsons whom the dead man left behind him; it enters their body and,Elementary Forms
41360,aids their growth. It remains thus in the midst of its former family for,Elementary Forms
41360,"a year or two, after which it goes back to the land of the souls. But",Elementary Forms
41360,after a certain length of time it goes away once more to make another,Elementary Forms
41360,"sojourn upon earth, which is to be the last. A time will come when it",Elementary Forms
41360,"must take up again, and with no hope of return this time, the route to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the isles of the dead; then, after various incidents, the details of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it is useless to relate, a storm will overtake it, in the course",Elementary Forms
41360,of which it will be struck by a flash of lightning. Thus its career is,Elementary Forms
41360,definitely terminated.[792],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So it cannot reincarnate itself; nor can conceptions and births be due,Elementary Forms
41360,to the reincarnation of souls which periodically commence new existences,Elementary Forms
41360,"in new bodies. It is true that Strehlow, as Spencer and Gillen, declares",Elementary Forms
41360,that for the Arunta commerce of the sexes is in no way the determining,Elementary Forms
41360,"condition of generation,[793] which is considered the result of mystic",Elementary Forms
41360,"operations, but different from the ones which the other observers told",Elementary Forms
41360,us about. It takes place in one or the other of the two following ways:,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Wherever an ancestor of the Alcheringa[794] times is believed to have,Elementary Forms
41360,"entered into the ground, there is either a stone or a tree representing",Elementary Forms
41360,his body. The tree or rock which has this mystic relation with the,Elementary Forms
41360,"departed hero is called _nanja_ according to Spencer and Gillen,[795]",Elementary Forms
41360,or _ngarra_ according to Strehlow.[796] Sometimes it is a water-hole,Elementary Forms
41360,"which is believed to have been formed in this way. Now, on each of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"trees or rocks and in each of these water-holes, there live embryo",Elementary Forms
41360,"children, called _ratapa_,[797] which belong to exactly the same totem",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the corresponding ancestor. For example, on a gum-tree representing",Elementary Forms
41360,"an ancestor of the kangaroo totem there are ratapa, all of which have",Elementary Forms
41360,"the kangaroo as their totem. If a woman happens to pass it, and she is",Elementary Forms
41360,of the matrimonial class to which the mothers of these ratapa should,Elementary Forms
41360,"belong,[798] one of them may enter her through the hip. The woman learns",Elementary Forms
41360,of this act by the characteristic pains which are the first symptoms of,Elementary Forms
41360,pregnancy. The child thus conceived will of course belong to the same,Elementary Forms
41360,totem as the ancestor upon whose mystical body he resided before,Elementary Forms
41360,becoming incarnate.[799],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In other cases, the process employed is slightly different: the ancestor",Elementary Forms
41360,himself acts in person. At a given moment he leaves his subterranean,Elementary Forms
41360,retreat and throws on to the passing woman a little churinga of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"special form, called _namatuna_.[800] The churinga enters the body of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the woman and takes a human form there, while the ancestor disappears",Elementary Forms
41360,again into the earth.[801],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These two ways of conception are believed to be equally frequent. The,Elementary Forms
41360,features of the child will reveal the manner in which he was conceived;,Elementary Forms
41360,"according to whether his face is broad or long, they say that he is the",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnation of a ratapa or a namatuna. Beside these two means of,Elementary Forms
41360,"fecundation, Strehlow places a third, which, however, is much more rare.",Elementary Forms
41360,"After his namatuna has penetrated into the body of the woman, the",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestor himself enters her and voluntarily submits to a new birth. So,Elementary Forms
41360,"in this case, the conception is due to a real reincarnation of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor. But this is very exceptional, and when a man who has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived thus dies, the ancestral soul which animated him goes away,",Elementary Forms
41360,"just like ordinary souls, to the isles of the dead where, after the",Elementary Forms
41360,"usual delays, it is definitely annihilated. So it cannot undergo any",Elementary Forms
41360,further reincarnations.[802],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Such is the version of Strehlow.[803] In the opinion of this author it,Elementary Forms
41360,is radically opposed to that of Spencer and Gillen. But in reality it,Elementary Forms
41360,"differs only in the letter of the formulae and symbols, while in both",Elementary Forms
41360,cases we find the same mythical theme in slightly different forms.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, all the observers agree that every conception is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"result of an incarnation. Only according to Strehlow, that which is",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnated is not a soul but a ratapa or a namatuna. But what is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"ratapa? Strehlow says that it is a complete embryo, made up of a soul",Elementary Forms
41360,and a body. But the soul is always represented in material forms; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"sleeps, dances, hunts, eats, etc. So it, too, has a corporal element.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Inversely, the ratapa is invisible to ordinary men; no one sees it as it",Elementary Forms
41360,enters the body of the woman;[804] this is equivalent to saying that it,Elementary Forms
41360,is made of a matter quite similar to that of the soul. So it hardly,Elementary Forms
41360,seems possible to differentiate the two clearly in this regard. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"reality, these are mythical beings which are obviously conceived after",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same model. Schulze calls them the souls of children.[805] Moreover,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ratapa, just like the soul, sustains the closest relations with the",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestor of which the sacred tree or rock is the materialized form. It,Elementary Forms
41360,"is of the same totem as this ancestor, of the same phratry and of the",Elementary Forms
41360,same matrimonial class.[806] Its place in the social organization of the,Elementary Forms
41360,tribe is the very one that its ancestor is believed to have held before,Elementary Forms
41360,"it. It bears the same name,[807] which is a proof that these two",Elementary Forms
41360,personalities are at least very closely related to one another.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there is more than this; this relationship even goes as far as a,Elementary Forms
41360,"complete identification. In fact, it is on the mystic body of the",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestor that the ratapa is formed; it comes from this; it is like a,Elementary Forms
41360,detached portion of it. So it really is a part of the ancestor which,Elementary Forms
41360,penetrates into the womb of the mother and which becomes the child. Thus,Elementary Forms
41360,we get back to the conception of Spencer and Gillen: birth is due to the,Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnation of an ancestral personage. Of course it is not the entire,Elementary Forms
41360,"person that is reincarnated, it is only an emanation from him. But this",Elementary Forms
41360,"difference has only a secondary interest, for when a sacred being",Elementary Forms
41360,"divides and duplicates itself, all of its essential characteristics are",Elementary Forms
41360,to be found again in each of the fragments into which it is broken up.,Elementary Forms
41360,So really the Alcheringa ancestor is entire in each part of himself,Elementary Forms
41360,which becomes a ratapa.[808],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The second mode of conception distinguished by Strehlow has the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"significance. In fact, the churinga, and more especially the particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"churinga that is called the namatuna, is considered a transformation of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ancestor; according to Strehlow,[809] it is his body, just as the",Elementary Forms
41360,"nanja tree is. In other words, the personality of the ancestor, his",Elementary Forms
41360,"churinga and his nanja tree, are sacred things, inspiring the same",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments and to which the same religious value is attributed. So they,Elementary Forms
41360,transmute themselves into one another: in the spot where an ancestor,Elementary Forms
41360,"lost his churinga, a sacred tree or rock has come out of the soil, just",Elementary Forms
41360,the same as in those places where he entered the ground himself.[810] So,Elementary Forms
41360,there is a mythological equivalence of a person of the Alcheringa and,Elementary Forms
41360,"his churinga; consequently, when the former throws a namatuna into the",Elementary Forms
41360,"body of a woman, it is as if he entered into it himself. In fact, we",Elementary Forms
41360,have seen that sometimes he does enter in person after the namatuna;,Elementary Forms
41360,according to other stories he precedes it; it might be said that he,Elementary Forms
41360,opens up the way for it.[811] The fact that these two themes exist side,Elementary Forms
41360,by side in the same myth completes the proof that one is only a doublet,Elementary Forms
41360,of the other.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, in whatever way the conception may have taken place, there can",Elementary Forms
41360,be no doubt that each individual is united to some determined ancestor,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Alcheringa by especially close bonds. In the first place, each",Elementary Forms
41360,man has his appointed ancestor; two persons cannot have the same one,Elementary Forms
41360,"simultaneously. In other words, a being of the Alcheringa never has more",Elementary Forms
41360,"than one representative among the living.[812] More than that, the one",Elementary Forms
41360,"is only an aspect of the other. In fact, as we already know, the",Elementary Forms
41360,churinga left by the ancestor expresses his personality; if we adopt the,Elementary Forms
41360,"interpretation of Strehlow, which, perhaps, is the more satisfactory, we",Elementary Forms
41360,shall say that it is his body. But this same churinga is related in the,Elementary Forms
41360,same way to the individual who is believed to have been conceived under,Elementary Forms
41360,"the influence of this ancestor, and who is the fruit of his mystic",Elementary Forms
41360,works. When the young initiate is introduced into the sanctuary of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clan, he is shown the churinga of his ancestor, and someone says to him,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""You are this body; you are the same thing as this.""[813] So, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow's own expression, the churinga is ""the body common to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual and his ancestor.""[814] Now if they are to have the same body",Elementary Forms
41360,it is necessary that on one side at least their two personalities be,Elementary Forms
41360,"confounded. Strehlow recognizes this explicitly, moreover, when he says,",Elementary Forms
41360,"""By the tjurunga (churinga) the individual is united to his personal",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor.""[815]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So for Strehlow as well as for Spencer and Gillen, there is a mystic,",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious principle in each new-born child, which emanates from an",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestor of the Alcheringa. It is this principle which forms the essence,Elementary Forms
41360,"of each individual, therefore it is his soul, or in any case the soul is",Elementary Forms
41360,made of the same matter and the same substance. Now it is only upon this,Elementary Forms
41360,one fundamental fact that we have relied in determining the nature and,Elementary Forms
41360,origin of the idea of the soul. The different metaphors by means of,Elementary Forms
41360,which it may have been expressed have only a secondary interest for,Elementary Forms
41360,us.[816],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Far from contradicting the data upon which our theory rests, the recent",Elementary Forms
41360,observations of Strehlow bring new proofs confirming it. Our reasoning,Elementary Forms
41360,consisted in inferring the totemic nature of the human soul from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic nature of the ancestral soul, of which the former is an",Elementary Forms
41360,"emanation and a sort of replica. Now, some of the new facts which we owe",Elementary Forms
41360,to Strehlow show this character of both even more categorically than,Elementary Forms
41360,"those we had at our disposal before do. In the first place, Strehlow,",Elementary Forms
41360,"like Spencer and Gillen, insists on ""the intimate relations uniting each",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor to an animal, to a plant, or to some other natural object.""",Elementary Forms
41360,Some of these Altjirangamitjina (these are Spencer and Gillen's men of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Alcheringa) ""should,"" he says, ""be manifested directly as animals;",Elementary Forms
41360,"others take the animal form in a way.""[817] Even now they are constantly",Elementary Forms
41360,"transforming themselves into animals.[818] In any case, whatever",Elementary Forms
41360,"external aspect they may have, ""the special and distinctive qualities of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal clearly appear in each of them."" For example, the ancestors",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Kangaroo clan eat grass just like real kangaroos, and flee before",Elementary Forms
41360,"the hunter; those of the Emu clan run and feed like emus,[819] etc. More",Elementary Forms
41360,"than that, those ancestors who had a vegetable as totem become this",Elementary Forms
41360,"vegetable itself on death.[820] Moreover, this close kinship of the",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestor and the totemic being is so keenly felt by the natives that it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is shown even in their terminology. Among the Arunta, the child calls",Elementary Forms
41360,"the totem of his mother, which serves him as a secondary totem,[821]",Elementary Forms
41360,"_altjira_. As filiation was at first in the uterine line, there was once",Elementary Forms
41360,a time when each individual had no other totem than that of his mother;,Elementary Forms
41360,so it is very probable that the term _altjira_ then designated the real,Elementary Forms
41360,totem. Now this clearly enters into the composition of the word which,Elementary Forms
41360,"means great ancestor, _altjirangamitjina_.[822]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The idea of the totem and that of the ancestor are even so closely,Elementary Forms
41360,"kindred that they sometimes seem to be confounded. Thus, after speaking",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the totem of the mother, or _altjira_, Strehlow goes on to say, ""This",Elementary Forms
41360,"altjira appears to the natives in dreams and gives them warnings, just",Elementary Forms
41360,"as it takes information concerning them to their sleeping friends.""[823]",Elementary Forms
41360,"This _altjira_, which speaks and which is attached to each individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"personally, is evidently an ancestor; yet it is also an incarnation of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the totem. A certain text in Roth, which speaks of invocations addressed",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the totem, should certainly be interpreted in this sense.[824] So it",Elementary Forms
41360,appears that the totem is sometimes represented in the mind in the form,Elementary Forms
41360,of a group of ideal beings or mythical personages who are more or less,Elementary Forms
41360,"indistinct from the ancestors. In a word, the ancestors are the",Elementary Forms
41360,fragments of the totem.[825],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if the ancestor is so readily confused with the totemic being, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual soul, which is so near the ancestral soul, cannot do",Elementary Forms
41360,"otherwise. Moreover, this is what actually results from the close union",Elementary Forms
41360,"of each man with his churinga. In fact, we know that the churinga",Elementary Forms
41360,represents the personality of the individual who is believed to have,Elementary Forms
41360,been born of it;[826] but it also expresses the totemic animal. When the,Elementary Forms
41360,"civilizing hero, Mangarkunjerkunja, presented each member of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kangaroo clan with his personal totem, he spoke as follows: ""Here is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"body of a kangaroo.""[827] Thus the churinga is at once the body of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor, of the individual himself and of the totemic animal; so,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to a strong and very just expression of Strehlow, these three",Elementary Forms
41360,"beings form a ""solid unity.""[828] They are almost equivalent and",Elementary Forms
41360,interchangeable terms. This is as much as to say that they are thought,Elementary Forms
41360,"of as different aspects of one and the same reality, which is also",Elementary Forms
41360,defined by the distinctive attributes of the totem. Their common essence,Elementary Forms
41360,is the totemic principle. The language itself expresses this identity.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The word ratapa, and the _aratapi_ of the Loritja language, designate",Elementary Forms
41360,the mythical embryo which is detached from the ancestor and which,Elementary Forms
41360,becomes the child; now these same words also designate the totem of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"same child, such as is determined by the spot where the mother believes",Elementary Forms
41360,that she conceived.[829],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Up to the present we have studied the doctrine of reincarnation only in,Elementary Forms
41360,the tribes of Central Australia; therefore the bases upon which our,Elementary Forms
41360,"inference rests may be deemed too narrow. But in the first place, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the reasons which we have pointed out, the experiment holds good outside",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the societies which we have observed directly. Also, there are",Elementary Forms
41360,abundant facts proving that the same or analogous conceptions are found,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the most diverse parts of Australia or, at least, have left very",Elementary Forms
41360,evident traces there. They are found even in America.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Howitt mentions them among the Dieri of South Australia.[830] The word,Elementary Forms
41360,"_Mura-mura_, which Gason translates with Good Spirit and which he thinks",Elementary Forms
41360,"expresses a belief in a god creator,[831] is really a collective word",Elementary Forms
41360,designating the group of ancestors placed by the myth at the beginning,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the tribe. They continue to exist to-day as formerly. ""They are",Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to live in trees, which are sacred for this reason."" Certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"irregularities of the ground, rocks and springs are identified with",Elementary Forms
41360,"these Mura-mura,[832] which consequently resemble the Altjirangamitjina",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Arunta in a singular way. The Kurnai of Gippsland, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"retaining only vestiges of totemism, also believe in the existence of",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestors called _Muk-Kurnai_, and which they think of as beings",Elementary Forms
41360,"intermediate between men and animals.[833] Among the Nimbaldi, Taplin",Elementary Forms
41360,has observed a theory of conception similar to that which Strehlow,Elementary Forms
41360,attributes to the Arunta.[834] We find this belief in reincarnation held,Elementary Forms
41360,"integrally by the Wotjobaluk in Victoria. ""The spirits of the dead,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"says Mathews, ""assemble in the _miyur_[835] of their respective clans;",Elementary Forms
41360,they leave these to be born again in human form when a favourable,Elementary Forms
41360,"occasion presents itself.""[836] Mathews even affirms that ""the belief in",Elementary Forms
41360,the reincarnation or transmigration of souls is strongly enrooted in all,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Australian tribes.""[837]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If we pass to the northern regions we find the pure doctrine of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Arunta among the Niol-Niol in the north-west; every birth is attributed,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the incarnation of a pre-existing soul, which introduces itself into",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body of a woman.[838] In northern Queensland myths, differing from",Elementary Forms
41360,"the preceding only in form, express exactly the same ideas. Among the",Elementary Forms
41360,tribes on the Pennefather River it is believed that every man has two,Elementary Forms
41360,"souls: the one, called _ngai_, resides in the heart; the other, called",Elementary Forms
41360,"_choi_, remains in the placenta. Soon after birth the placenta is buried",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a consecrated place. A particular genius, named Anje-a, who has",Elementary Forms
41360,"charge of the phenomena of procreation, comes to get this _choi_ and",Elementary Forms
41360,"keeps it until the child, being grown up, is married. When the time",Elementary Forms
41360,"comes to give him a son, Anje-a takes a bit of the choi of this man,",Elementary Forms
41360,"places it in the embryo he is making, and inserts it into the womb of",Elementary Forms
41360,the mother. So it is out of the soul of the father that that of the,Elementary Forms
41360,child is made. It is true that the child does not receive the paternal,Elementary Forms
41360,"soul integrally at first, for the _ngai_ remains in the heart of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"father as long as he lives. But when he dies the _ngai_, being",Elementary Forms
41360,"liberated, also incarnates itself in the bodies of the children; if",Elementary Forms
41360,there are several children it is divided equally among them. Thus there,Elementary Forms
41360,is a perfect spiritual continuity between the generations; it is the,Elementary Forms
41360,same soul which is transmitted from a father to his children and from,Elementary Forms
41360,"these to their children, and this unique soul, always remaining itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"in spite of its successive divisions and subdivisions, is the one which",Elementary Forms
41360,animated the first ancestor at the beginning of all things.[839] Between,Elementary Forms
41360,this theory and the one held by the central tribes there is only one,Elementary Forms
41360,difference of any importance; this is that the reincarnation is not the,Elementary Forms
41360,work of the ancestors themselves but that of a special genius who takes,Elementary Forms
41360,charge of this function professionally. But it seems probable that this,Elementary Forms
41360,genius is the product of a syncretism which has fused the numerous,Elementary Forms
41360,figures of the first ancestors into one single being. This hypothesis is,Elementary Forms
41360,at least made probable by the fact that the words Anje-a and Anjir are,Elementary Forms
41360,"evidently very closely related; now the second designates the first man,",Elementary Forms
41360,the original ancestor from whom all men are descended.[840],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These same ideas are found again among the Indian tribes of America.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Krauss says that among the Tlinkit, the souls of the departed are",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to come back to earth and introduce themselves into the bodies,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the pregnant women of their families. ""So when a woman dreams, during",Elementary Forms
41360,"pregnancy, of some deceased relative, she believes that the soul of this",Elementary Forms
41360,latter has penetrated into her. If the young child has some,Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristic mark which the dead man had before, they believe that it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is the dead man himself come back to earth, and his name is given to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"child.""[841] This belief is also general among the Haida. It is the",Elementary Forms
41360,shaman who reveals which relative it was who reincarnated himself in the,Elementary Forms
41360,child and what name should consequently be given to him.[842] Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,Kwakiutl it is believed that the latest member of a family who died,Elementary Forms
41360,comes back to life in the person of the first child to be born in that,Elementary Forms
41360,"family.[843] It is the same with the Hurons, the Iroquois, the Tinneh,",Elementary Forms
41360,and many other tribes of the United States.[844],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The universality of these conceptions extends, of course, to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"conclusion which we have deduced from them, that is, to the explanation",Elementary Forms
41360,of the idea of the soul which we have proposed. Its general,Elementary Forms
41360,acceptability is also proved by the following facts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We know[845] that each individual contains within him something of that,Elementary Forms
41360,anonymous force which is diffused in the sacred species; he is a member,Elementary Forms
41360,"of this species himself. But as an empirical and visible being, he is",Elementary Forms
41360,"not, for, in spite of the symbolic designs and marks with which he",Elementary Forms
41360,"decorates his body, there is nothing in him to suggest the form of an",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal or plant. So it must be that there is another being in him, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"whom he recognizes himself, but whom he represents in the form of an",Elementary Forms
41360,animal or vegetable species. Now is it not evident that this double can,Elementary Forms
41360,"only be the soul, since the soul is, of itself, already a double of the",Elementary Forms
41360,subject whom it animates? The justification of this identification is,Elementary Forms
41360,completed by the fact that the organs where the fragment of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,principle contained in each individual incarnates itself the most,Elementary Forms
41360,eminently are also those where the soul resides. This is the case with,Elementary Forms
41360,"the blood. The blood contains something of the nature of the totem, as",Elementary Forms
41360,is proved by the part it takes in the totemic ceremonies.[846] But at,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same time, the blood is one of the seats of the soul; or rather, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is the soul itself, seen from without. When blood flows, life runs out",Elementary Forms
41360,"and, in the same process, the soul escapes. So the soul is confused with",Elementary Forms
41360,the sacred principle which is imminent in the blood.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Regarding matters from another point of view, if our explanation is",Elementary Forms
41360,"well-founded, the totemic principle, in penetrating into the individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"as we suppose, should retain a certain amount of autonomy there, since",Elementary Forms
41360,it is quite distinct from the subject in whom it is incarnated. Now this,Elementary Forms
41360,"is just what Howitt claims to have observed among the Yuin: ""That in",Elementary Forms
41360,this tribe the totem is thought to be in some way part of a man is,Elementary Forms
41360,"clearly seen by the case of Umbara, before mentioned, who told me that,",Elementary Forms
41360,"many years ago, someone of the Lace-lizard totem sent it while he was",Elementary Forms
41360,"asleep, and that it went down his throat and almost ate his totem, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"was in his breast, so that he nearly died.""[847] So it is quite true",Elementary Forms
41360,that the totem is broken up in individualizing itself and that each of,Elementary Forms
41360,the bits thus detached plays the part of a spirit or soul residing in,Elementary Forms
41360,the body.[848],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there are other more clearly demonstrative facts. If the soul is,Elementary Forms
41360,"only the totemic principle individualized, it should have, in certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"cases at least, rather close relations with the animal or vegetable",Elementary Forms
41360,"species whose form is reproduced by the totem. And, in fact, ""the",Elementary Forms
41360,Geawe-Gal (a tribe of New South Wales) had a superstition that everyone,Elementary Forms
41360,"had within himself an affinity to the spirit of some bird, beast or",Elementary Forms
41360,"reptile. Not that he sprung from the creature in any way, but that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"spirit which was in him was akin to that of the creature.""[849]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There are even cases where the soul is believed to emanate directly from,Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal or vegetable serving as totem. Among the Arunta, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow, when a woman has eaten a great deal of fruit, it is believed",Elementary Forms
41360,that she will give birth to a child who will have this fruit as totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,"If, at the moment when she felt the first tremblings of the child, she",Elementary Forms
41360,"was looking at a kangaroo, it is believed that the ratapa of the",Elementary Forms
41360,kangaroo has entered her body and fertilized her.[850] H. Basedow,Elementary Forms
41360,"reported the same fact from the Wogait.[851] We know, also, that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ratapa and the soul are almost indistinguishable things. Now, such an",Elementary Forms
41360,origin could never have been attributed to the soul if men did not think,Elementary Forms
41360,that it was made out of the same substances as the plants and animals of,Elementary Forms
41360,the totemic species.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the soul is frequently represented in an animal form. It is known,Elementary Forms
41360,"that in inferior societies, death is never considered a natural event,",Elementary Forms
41360,due to the action of purely physical causes; it is generally attributed,Elementary Forms
41360,to the evil workings of some sorcerer. In a large number of Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,"societies, in order to determine who is the responsible author of this",Elementary Forms
41360,"murder, they work on the principle that the soul of the murderer must",Elementary Forms
41360,"inevitably come to visit its victim. Therefore, the body is placed upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"a scaffolding; then, the ground under the corpse and all around it is",Elementary Forms
41360,carefully smoothed off so that the slightest mark becomes easily,Elementary Forms
41360,perceptible. They return the next day; if an animal has passed by there,Elementary Forms
41360,"during the interval, its tracks are readily recognizable. Their form",Elementary Forms
41360,"reveals the species to which it belongs, and from that, they infer the",Elementary Forms
41360,social group of which the guilty man is a member. They say that it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"man of such a class or such a clan,[852] according to whether the",Elementary Forms
41360,animal is the totem of this or that class or clan. So the soul is,Elementary Forms
41360,believed to have come in the form of the totemic animal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In other societies where totemism has weakened or disappeared, the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,still continues to be thought of in an animal form. The natives of Cape,Elementary Forms
41360,"Bedford (North Queensland) believe that the child, at the moment of",Elementary Forms
41360,"entering the body of its mother, is a curlew if it is a girl, or a snake",Elementary Forms
41360,if it is a boy.[853] It is only later that it takes a human form. Many,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Indians of North America, says the Prince of Wied, say that they",Elementary Forms
41360,have an animal in their bodies.[854] The Bororo of Brazil represent the,Elementary Forms
41360,"soul in the form of a bird, and therefore believe that they are birds of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same variety.[855] In other places, it is thought of as a snake, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"lizard, a fly, a bee, etc.[856]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is especially after death that this animal nature of the soul is,Elementary Forms
41360,"manifested. During life, this characteristic is partially veiled, as it",Elementary Forms
41360,"were, by the very form of the human body. But when death has once set it",Elementary Forms
41360,"free, it becomes itself again. Among the Omaha, in at least two of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Buffalo clans, it is believed that the souls of the dead go to rejoin",Elementary Forms
41360,"the buffalo, their ancestors.[857] The Hopi are divided into a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"number of clans, whose ancestors were animals or beings with animal",Elementary Forms
41360,"forms. Now Schoolcraft tells us that they say that at death, they take",Elementary Forms
41360,"their original form again; each becomes a bear or deer, according to the",Elementary Forms
41360,clan to which he belongs.[858] Very frequently the soul is believed to,Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnate itself in the body of an animal.[859] It is probably from,Elementary Forms
41360,this that the widely-spread doctrine of metempsychosis was derived. We,Elementary Forms
41360,have already seen how hard pressed Tylor is to account for it.[860] If,Elementary Forms
41360,"the soul is an essentially human principle, what could be more curious",Elementary Forms
41360,"than this marked predilection which it shows, in so large a number of",Elementary Forms
41360,"societies, for the animal form? On the other hand, everything is",Elementary Forms
41360,"explained if, by its very constitution, the soul is closely related to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal, for in that case, when it returns to the animal world at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"close of this life, it is only returning to its real nature. Thus the",Elementary Forms
41360,generality of the belief in metempsychosis is a new proof that the,Elementary Forms
41360,constituent elements of the idea of the soul have been taken largely,Elementary Forms
41360,"from the animal kingdom, as is presupposed by the theory which we have",Elementary Forms
41360,just set forth.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the notion of the soul is a particular application of the beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,relative to sacred beings. This is the explanation of the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,character which this idea has had from the moment when it first appeared,Elementary Forms
41360,"in history, and which it still retains to-day. In fact, the soul has",Elementary Forms
41360,"always been considered a sacred thing; on this ground, it is opposed to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body which is, in itself, profane. It is not merely distinguished",Elementary Forms
41360,from its material envelope as the inside from the outside; it is not,Elementary Forms
41360,merely represented as made out of a more subtle and fluid matter; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"more than this, it inspires those sentiments which are everywhere",Elementary Forms
41360,"reserved for that which is divine. If it is not made into a god, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,at least regarded as a spark of the divinity. This essential,Elementary Forms
41360,characteristic would be inexplicable if the idea of the soul were only a,Elementary Forms
41360,pre-scientific solution given to the problem of dreams; for there is,Elementary Forms
41360,"nothing in the dream to awaken religious emotions, so the cause by which",Elementary Forms
41360,these are explained could not have such a character. But if the soul is,Elementary Forms
41360,"a part of the divine substance, it represents something not ourselves",Elementary Forms
41360,that is within us; if it is made of the same mental matter as the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings, it is natural that it should become the object of the same",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,And the sacred character which men thus attribute to themselves is not,Elementary Forms
41360,the product of a pure illusion either; like the notions of religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"force and of divinity, the notion of the soul is not without a",Elementary Forms
41360,foundation in reality. It is perfectly true that we are made up of two,Elementary Forms
41360,"distinct parts, which are opposed to one another as the sacred to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"profane, and we may say that, in a certain sense, there is divinity in",Elementary Forms
41360,"us. For society, this unique source of all that is sacred, does not",Elementary Forms
41360,limit itself to moving us from without and affecting us for the moment;,Elementary Forms
41360,it establishes itself within us in a durable manner. It arouses within,Elementary Forms
41360,"us a whole world of ideas and sentiments which express it but which, at",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same time, form an integral and permanent part of ourselves. When",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Australian goes away from a religious ceremony, the representations",Elementary Forms
41360,which this communal life has aroused or re-aroused within him are not,Elementary Forms
41360,"obliterated in a second. The figures of the great ancestors, the heroic",Elementary Forms
41360,"exploits whose memory these rites perpetuate, the great deeds of every",Elementary Forms
41360,"sort in which he, too, has participated through the cult, in a word, all",Elementary Forms
41360,these numerous ideals which he has elaborated with the co-operation of,Elementary Forms
41360,"his fellows, continue to live in his consciousness and, through the",Elementary Forms
41360,emotions which are attached to them and the ascendancy which they hold,Elementary Forms
41360,"over his entire being, they are sharply distinguished from the vulgar",Elementary Forms
41360,impressions arising from his daily relations with external things. Moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas have the same character. It is society which forces them upon us,",Elementary Forms
41360,and as the respect inspired by it is naturally extended to all that,Elementary Forms
41360,"comes from it, its imperative rules of conduct are invested, by reason",Elementary Forms
41360,"of their origin, with an authority and a dignity which is shared by none",Elementary Forms
41360,"of our internal states: therefore, we assign them a place apart in our",Elementary Forms
41360,psychical life. Although our moral conscience is a part of our,Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness, we do not feel ourselves on an equality with it. In this",Elementary Forms
41360,voice which makes itself heard only to give us orders and establish,Elementary Forms
41360,"prohibitions, we cannot recognize our own voices; the very tone in which",Elementary Forms
41360,it speaks to us warns us that it expresses something within us that is,Elementary Forms
41360,not of ourselves. This is the objective foundation of the idea of the,Elementary Forms
41360,soul: those representations whose flow constitutes our interior life are,Elementary Forms
41360,of two different species which are irreducible one into another. Some,Elementary Forms
41360,"concern themselves with the external and material world; others, with an",Elementary Forms
41360,ideal world to which we attribute a moral superiority over the first. So,Elementary Forms
41360,we are really made up of two beings facing in different and almost,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary directions, one of whom exercises a real pre-eminence over the",Elementary Forms
41360,other. Such is the profound meaning of the antithesis which all men have,Elementary Forms
41360,"more or less clearly conceived between the body and the soul, the",Elementary Forms
41360,material and the spiritual beings who coexist within us. Moralists and,Elementary Forms
41360,preachers have often maintained that no one can deny the reality of duty,Elementary Forms
41360,and its sacred character without falling into materialism. And it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"true that if we have no idea of moral and religious imperatives, our",Elementary Forms
41360,"psychical life will all be reduced to one level,[861] all our states of",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness will be on the same plane, and all feeling of duality",Elementary Forms
41360,"will perish. To make this duality intelligible, it is, of course, in no",Elementary Forms
41360,"way necessary to imagine a mysterious and unrepresentable substance,",Elementary Forms
41360,"under the name of the soul, which is opposed to the body. But here, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"in regard to the idea of sacredness, the error concerns the letter of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the symbol employed, not the reality of the fact symbolized. It remains",Elementary Forms
41360,true that our nature is double; there really is a particle of divinity,Elementary Forms
41360,in us because there is within us us a particle of these great ideas,Elementary Forms
41360,which are the soul of the group.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So the individual soul is only a portion of the collective soul of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"group; it is the anonymous force at the basis of the cult, but",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnated in an individual whose personality it espouses; it is _mana_,Elementary Forms
41360,individualized. Perhaps dreams aided in determining certain secondary,Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics of the idea. The inconsistency and instability of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"images which fill our minds during sleep, and their remarkable aptitude",Elementary Forms
41360,"for transforming themselves into one another, may have furnished the",Elementary Forms
41360,"model for this subtile, transparent and Protean matter out of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"soul is believed to be made. Also, the facts of swooning, catalepsy,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc., may have suggested the idea that the soul was mobile, and quitted",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body temporarily during this life; this, in its turn, has served to",Elementary Forms
41360,explain certain dreams. But all these experiences and observations could,Elementary Forms
41360,"have had only a secondary and complimentary influence, whose very",Elementary Forms
41360,existence it is difficult to establish. All that is really essential in,Elementary Forms
41360,the idea comes from elsewhere.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But does not this genesis of the idea of the soul misunderstand its,Elementary Forms
41360,essential characteristic? If the soul is a particular form of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"impersonal principle which is diffused in the group, the totemic species",Elementary Forms
41360,"and all the things of every sort which are attached to these, at bottom",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is impersonal itself. So, with differences only of degree, it should",Elementary Forms
41360,"have the same properties as the force of which it is a special form, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"particularly, the same diffusion, the same aptitude for spreading itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"contagiously and the same ubiquity. But quite on the contrary, the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,"is voluntarily represented as a concrete, definite being, wholly",Elementary Forms
41360,contained within itself and not communicable to others; it is made the,Elementary Forms
41360,basis of our personality.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this way of conceiving the soul is the product of a late and,Elementary Forms
41360,"philosophic elaboration. The popular representation, as it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"spontaneously formed from common experience, is very different,",Elementary Forms
41360,"especially at first. For the Australian, the soul is a very vague",Elementary Forms
41360,"thing, undecided and wavering in form, and spread over the whole",Elementary Forms
41360,"organism. Though it manifests itself especially at certain points, there",Elementary Forms
41360,are probably none from which it is totally absent. So it has a,Elementary Forms
41360,"diffusion, a contagiousness and an omnipresence comparable to those of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the _mana_. Like the mana, it is able to divide and duplicate itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"infinitely, though remaining entire in each of its parts; it is from",Elementary Forms
41360,these divisions and duplications that the plurality of souls is derived.,Elementary Forms
41360,"On the other hand, the doctrine of reincarnation, whose generality we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have established, shows how many impersonal elements enter into the idea",Elementary Forms
41360,of the soul and how essential those are. For if the same soul is going,Elementary Forms
41360,"to clothe a new personality in each generation, the individual forms in",Elementary Forms
41360,which it successively develops itself must all be equally external to,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, and have nothing to do with its true nature. It is a sort of generic",Elementary Forms
41360,substance which individualizes itself only secondarily and,Elementary Forms
41360,"superficially. Moreover, this conception of the soul is by no means",Elementary Forms
41360,completely gone. The cult of relics shows that for a host of believers,Elementary Forms
41360,"even to-day, the soul of a saint, with all its essential powers,",Elementary Forms
41360,continues to adhere to his different bones; and this implies that he is,Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to be able to diffuse himself, subdivide himself and",Elementary Forms
41360,incorporate himself in all sorts of different things simultaneously.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Just as the characteristic attributes of the mana are found in the soul,",Elementary Forms
41360,so secondary and superficial changes are enough to enable the mana to,Elementary Forms
41360,individualize itself in the form of a soul. We pass from the first idea,Elementary Forms
41360,to the second with no break of continuity. Every religious force which,Elementary Forms
41360,is attached in a special way to a determined being participates in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristics of this being, takes on its appearance and becomes its",Elementary Forms
41360,"spiritual double. Tregear, in his Maori-Polynesian dictionary, has",Elementary Forms
41360,thought it possible to connect the word _mana_ with another group of,Elementary Forms
41360,"words, such as _manawa_, _manamana_, etc., which seem to belong to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same family, and which signify heart, life, consciousness.[862] Is this",Elementary Forms
41360,not equivalent to saying that some sort of kinship ought to exist,Elementary Forms
41360,"between the corresponding ideas as well, that is to say, between the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of impersonal force and those of internal life, mental force and,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a word, of the soul? This is why the question whether the churinga is",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred because it serves as the residence of a soul, as Spencer and",Elementary Forms
41360,"Gillen believe, or because it has impersonal virtues, as Strehlow",Elementary Forms
41360,"thinks, seems to us to have little interest and to be without",Elementary Forms
41360,sociological importance. Whether the efficacy of a sacred object is,Elementary Forms
41360,represented in an abstract form in the mind or is attributed to some,Elementary Forms
41360,personal agent does not really matter. The psychological roots of both,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs are identical: an object is sacred because it inspires, in one",Elementary Forms
41360,"way or another, a collective sentiment of respect which removes it from",Elementary Forms
41360,"profane touches. In order to explain this sentiment, men sometimes fall",Elementary Forms
41360,"back on to a vague and imprecise cause, and sometimes on to a determined",Elementary Forms
41360,spiritual being endowed with a name and a history; but these different,Elementary Forms
41360,interpretations are superadded to one fundamental phenomenon which is,Elementary Forms
41360,the same in both cases.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This, moreover, is what explains the singular confusions, examples of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which we have met with as we have progressed. The individual, the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,of the ancestor which he reincarnates or from which his own is an,Elementary Forms
41360,"emanation, his churinga and the animals of the totemic species are, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"we have said, partially equivalent and interchangeable things. This is",Elementary Forms
41360,"because in certain connections, they all affect the collective",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness in the same way. If the churinga is sacred, it is because",Elementary Forms
41360,of the collective sentiments of respect inspired by the totemic emblem,Elementary Forms
41360,carved upon its surface; now the same sentiment attaches itself to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"animals or plants whose outward form is reproduced by the totem, to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"soul of the individual, for it is thought of in the form of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"being, and finally to the ancestral soul, of which the preceding one is",Elementary Forms
41360,"only a particular aspect. So all these various objects, whether real or",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideal, have one common element by which they arouse a single affective",Elementary Forms
41360,"state in the mind, and through this, they become confused. In so far as",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are expressed by one and the same representation, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,indistinct. This is how the Arunta has come to regard the churinga as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the body common to the individual, the ancestor and even the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,being. It is his way of expressing the identity of the sentiments of,Elementary Forms
41360,which these different things are the object.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it does not follow from the fact the idea of the soul is",Elementary Forms
41360,derived from the idea of mana that the first has a relatively later,Elementary Forms
41360,"origin, or that there was a period in history when men were acquainted",Elementary Forms
41360,with religious forces only in their impersonal forms. When some wish to,Elementary Forms
41360,designate by the word preanimist an historical period during which,Elementary Forms
41360,"animism was completely unknown, they build up an arbitrary",Elementary Forms
41360,hypothesis;[863] for there is no people among whom the ideas of the soul,Elementary Forms
41360,and of mana do not coexist side by side. So there is no ground for,Elementary Forms
41360,"imagining that they were formed at two distinct times; everything, on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, goes to show that the two are coeval. Just as there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,"society without individuals, so those impersonal forces which are",Elementary Forms
41360,disengaged from the group cannot establish themselves without,Elementary Forms
41360,incarnating themselves in the individual consciousnesses where they,Elementary Forms
41360,"individualize themselves. In reality, we do not have two different",Elementary Forms
41360,"developments, but two different aspects of one and the same development.",Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that they do not have an equal importance; one is more,Elementary Forms
41360,essential than the other. The idea of mana does not presuppose the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,of the soul; for if the mana is going to individualize itself and break,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself up into the particular souls, it must first of all exist, and",Elementary Forms
41360,what it is in itself does not depend upon the forms it takes when,Elementary Forms
41360,"individualized. But on the contrary, the idea of the soul cannot be",Elementary Forms
41360,understood except when taken in connection with the idea of mana. So on,Elementary Forms
41360,"this ground, it is possible to say that it is the result of a secondary",Elementary Forms
41360,"formation; but we are speaking of a secondary formation in the logical,",Elementary Forms
41360,"not the chronological, sense of the word.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,V,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But how does it come that men have believed that the soul survives the,Elementary Forms
41360,body and is even able to do so for an indefinite length of time?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From the analysis which we have made, it is evident that the belief in",Elementary Forms
41360,immortality has not been established under the influence of moral ideas.,Elementary Forms
41360,Men have not imagined the prolongation of their existence beyond the,Elementary Forms
41360,tomb in order that a just retribution for moral acts may be assured in,Elementary Forms
41360,"another life, if it fails in this one; for we have seen that all",Elementary Forms
41360,considerations of this sort are foreign to the primitive conception of,Elementary Forms
41360,the beyond.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nor is the other hypothesis any better, according to which the other",Elementary Forms
41360,life was imagined as a means of escaping the agonizing prospect of,Elementary Forms
41360,"annihilation. In the first place, it is not true that the need of",Elementary Forms
41360,personal survival was actively felt at the beginning. The primitive,Elementary Forms
41360,generally accepts the idea of death with a sort of indifference. Being,Elementary Forms
41360,"trained to count his own individuality for little, and being accustomed",Elementary Forms
41360,"to exposing his life constantly, he gives it up easily enough.[864] More",Elementary Forms
41360,"than that, the immortality promised by the religions he practices is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"personal. In a large number of cases, the soul does not continue the",Elementary Forms
41360,"personality of the dead man, or does not continue it long, for,",Elementary Forms
41360,"forgetful of its previous existence, it goes away, after a while, to",Elementary Forms
41360,animate another body and thus becomes the vivifying principle of a new,Elementary Forms
41360,"personality. Even among the most advanced peoples, it was only a pale",Elementary Forms
41360,"and sad existence that shades led in Sheol or Erebus, and could hardly",Elementary Forms
41360,attenuate the regrets occasioned by the memories of the life lost.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A more satisfactory explanation is the one attaching the conception of a,Elementary Forms
41360,posthumous life to the experiences of dreams. Our dead friends and,Elementary Forms
41360,"relatives reappear to us in dreams: we see them act, we hear them speak;",Elementary Forms
41360,it is natural to conclude that they continue to exist. But if these,Elementary Forms
41360,"observations were able to confirm the idea after it had once been born,",Elementary Forms
41360,they hardly seem capable of creating it out of nothing. Dreams in which,Elementary Forms
41360,we see departed persons living again are too rare and too short and,Elementary Forms
41360,"leave only too vague recollections of themselves, to have been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,suggest so important a system of beliefs to men all by themselves. There,Elementary Forms
41360,is a remarkable lack of proportion between the effect and the cause to,Elementary Forms
41360,which it is attributed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"What makes this question embarrassing is the fact that in itself, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of the soul does not imply that of its survival, but rather seems",Elementary Forms
41360,"to exclude it. In fact, we have seen that the soul, though being",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguished from the body, is believed, nevertheless, to be closely",Elementary Forms
41360,"united to it: it ages along with the body, it feels a reaction from all",Elementary Forms
41360,the maladies that fall upon the body; so it would seem natural that it,Elementary Forms
41360,"should die with the body. At least, men ought to have believed that it",Elementary Forms
41360,ceased to exist from the moment when it definitely lost its original,Elementary Forms
41360,"form, and when it was no longer what it had been. Yet it is at just this",Elementary Forms
41360,moment that a new life opens out before it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The myths which we have already described give the only possible,Elementary Forms
41360,explanation of this belief. We have seen that the souls of new-born,Elementary Forms
41360,"children are either emanations of the ancestral souls, or these souls",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves reincarnated. But in order that they may either reincarnate,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves, or periodically give off new emanations, they must have",Elementary Forms
41360,survived their first holders. So it seems as though they admitted the,Elementary Forms
41360,survival of the dead in order to explain the birth of the living. The,Elementary Forms
41360,primitive does not have the idea of an all-powerful god who creates,Elementary Forms
41360,souls out of nothing. It seems to him that souls cannot be made except,Elementary Forms
41360,out of souls. So those who are born can only be new forms of those who,Elementary Forms
41360,"have been; consequently, it is necessary that these latter continue to",Elementary Forms
41360,"exist in order that others may be born. In fine, the belief in the",Elementary Forms
41360,immortality of the soul is the only way in which men were able to,Elementary Forms
41360,explain a fact which could not fail to attract their attention; this,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact is the perpetuity of the life of the group. Individuals die, but",Elementary Forms
41360,the clan survives. So the forces which give it life must have the same,Elementary Forms
41360,perpetuity. Now these forces are the souls which animate individual,Elementary Forms
41360,bodies; for it is in them and through them that the group is realized.,Elementary Forms
41360,"For this reason, it is necessary that they endure. It is even necessary",Elementary Forms
41360,"that in enduring, they remain always the same; for, as the clan always",Elementary Forms
41360,"keeps its characteristic appearance, the spiritual substance out of",Elementary Forms
41360,which it is made must be thought of as qualitatively invariable. Since,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is always the same clan with the same totemic principle, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary that the souls be the same, for souls are only the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,principle broken up and particularized. Thus there is something like a,Elementary Forms
41360,"germinative plasm, of a mystic order, which is transmitted from",Elementary Forms
41360,"generation to generation and which makes, or at least is believed to",Elementary Forms
41360,"make, the spiritual unity of the clan through all time. And this belief,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in spite of its symbolic character, is not without a certain objective",Elementary Forms
41360,truth. For though the group may not be immortal in the absolute sense of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the word, still it is true that it endures longer than the individuals",Elementary Forms
41360,and that it is born and incarnated afresh in each new generation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A fact confirms this interpretation. We have seen that according to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"testimony of Strehlow, the Arunta distinguish two sorts of souls: on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"one hand are those of the ancestors of the Alcheringa, on the other,",Elementary Forms
41360,those of the individuals who actually compose the active body of the,Elementary Forms
41360,tribe at each moment in history. The second sort only survive the body,Elementary Forms
41360,for a relatively short time; they are soon totally annihilated. Only the,Elementary Forms
41360,"former are immortal; as they are uncreated, so they do not perish. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,also to be noticed that they are the only ones whose immortality is,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary to explain the permanence of the group; for it is upon them,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and upon them alone, that it is incumbent to assure the perpetuity of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the clan, for every conception is their work. In this connection, the",Elementary Forms
41360,others have no part to play. So souls are not said to be immortal except,Elementary Forms
41360,in so far as this immortality is useful in rendering intelligible the,Elementary Forms
41360,continuity of the collective life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the causes leading to the first beliefs in a future life had no,Elementary Forms
41360,connections with the functions to be filled at a later period by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"institutions beyond the tomb. But when that had once appeared, they were",Elementary Forms
41360,soon utilized for other purposes besides those which had been their,Elementary Forms
41360,"original reasons for existence. Even in the Australian societies, we see",Elementary Forms
41360,"them beginning to organize themselves for this other purpose. Moreover,",Elementary Forms
41360,there was no need of any fundamental transformation for this. How true,Elementary Forms
41360,it is that the same social institution can successively fulfil different,Elementary Forms
41360,functions without changing its nature!,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,VI,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The idea of the soul was for a long time, and still is in part, the",Elementary Forms
41360,popular form of the idea of personality.[865] So the genesis of the,Elementary Forms
41360,former of these ideas should aid us in understanding how the second one,Elementary Forms
41360,was formed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From what has already been said, it is clear that the notion of person",Elementary Forms
41360,is the product of two sorts of factors. One of these is essentially,Elementary Forms
41360,impersonal: it is the spiritual principle serving as the soul of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"group. In fact, it is this which constitutes the very substance of",Elementary Forms
41360,individual souls. Now this is not the possession of any one in,Elementary Forms
41360,particular: it is a part of the collective patrimony; in it and through,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, all consciousnesses communicate. But on the other hand, in order to",Elementary Forms
41360,"have separate personalities, it is necessary that another factor",Elementary Forms
41360,"intervene to break up and differentiate this principle: in other words,",Elementary Forms
41360,an individualizing factor is necessary. It is the body that fulfils this,Elementary Forms
41360,"function. As bodies are distinct from each other, and as they occupy",Elementary Forms
41360,"different points of space and time, each of them forms a special centre",Elementary Forms
41360,about which the collective representations reflect and colour themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,differently. The result is that even if all the consciousnesses in these,Elementary Forms
41360,"bodies are directed towards the same world, to wit, the world of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas and sentiments which brings about the moral unity of the group,",Elementary Forms
41360,they do not all see it from the same angle; each one expresses it in its,Elementary Forms
41360,own fashion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Of these two equally indispensable factors, the former is certainly not",Elementary Forms
41360,"the less important, for this is the one which furnishes the original",Elementary Forms
41360,matter for the idea of the soul. Perhaps some will be surprised to see,Elementary Forms
41360,so considerable a role attributed to the impersonal element in the,Elementary Forms
41360,genesis of the idea of personality. But the philosophical analysis of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the idea of person, which has gone far ahead of the sociological",Elementary Forms
41360,"analysis, has reached analogous results on this point. Among all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"philosophers, Leibniz is one of those who have felt most vividly what a",Elementary Forms
41360,"personality is; for before all, the nomad is a personal and autonomous",Elementary Forms
41360,"being. Yet, for Leibniz, the contents of all the monads is identical. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, all are consciousnesses which express one and the same object, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"world; and as the world itself is only a system of representations, each",Elementary Forms
41360,particular consciousness is really only the reflection of the universal,Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness. However, each one expresses it from its own point of",Elementary Forms
41360,"view, and in its own manner. We know how this difference of perspectives",Elementary Forms
41360,comes from the fact that the monads are situated differently in,Elementary Forms
41360,relation to each other and to the whole system which they constitute.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Kant expresses the same sentiment, though in a different form. For him,",Elementary Forms
41360,the corner-stone of the personality is the will. Now the will is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"faculty of acting in conformity with reason, and the reason is that",Elementary Forms
41360,which is most impersonal within us. For reason is not my reason; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,human reason in general. It is the power which the mind has of rising,Elementary Forms
41360,"above the particular, the contingent and the individual, to think in",Elementary Forms
41360,"universal forms. So from this point of view, we may say that what makes",Elementary Forms
41360,"a man a personality is that by which he is confounded with other men,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that which makes him a man, not a certain man. The senses, the body and,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a word, all that individualizes, is, on the contrary, considered as",Elementary Forms
41360,the antagonist of the personality by Kant.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is because individuation is not the essential characteristic of the,Elementary Forms
41360,personality. A person is not merely a single subject distinguished from,Elementary Forms
41360,all the others. It is especially a being to which is attributed a,Elementary Forms
41360,relative autonomy in relation to the environment with which it is most,Elementary Forms
41360,"immediately in contact. It is represented as capable of moving itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,to a certain degree: this is what Leibniz expressed in an exaggerated,Elementary Forms
41360,way when he said that the monad was completely closed to the outside.,Elementary Forms
41360,Now our analysis permits us to see how this conception was formed and to,Elementary Forms
41360,what it corresponds.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, the soul, a symbolic representation of the personality, has the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same characteristic. Although closely bound to the body, it is believed",Elementary Forms
41360,"to be profoundly distinct from it and to enjoy, in relation to it, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"large degree of independence. During life, it may leave it temporarily,",Elementary Forms
41360,and it definitely withdraws at death. Far from being dependent upon the,Elementary Forms
41360,"body, it dominates it from the higher dignity which is in it. It may",Elementary Forms
41360,well take from the body the outward form in which it individualizes,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, but it owes nothing essential to it. Nor is the autonomy which",Elementary Forms
41360,all peoples have attributed to the soul a pure illusion; we know now,Elementary Forms
41360,what its objective foundation is. It is quite true that the elements,Elementary Forms
41360,which serve to form the idea of the soul and those which enter into the,Elementary Forms
41360,representation of the body come from two different sources that are,Elementary Forms
41360,independent of one another. One sort are made up of the images and,Elementary Forms
41360,impressions coming from all parts of the organism; the others consist in,Elementary Forms
41360,the ideas and sentiments which come from and express society. So the,Elementary Forms
41360,former are not derived from the latter. There really is a part of,Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves which is not placed in immediate dependence upon the organic,Elementary Forms
41360,factor: this is all that which represents society in us. The general,Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas which religion or science fix in our minds, the mental operations",Elementary Forms
41360,"which these ideas suppose, the beliefs and sentiments which are at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"basis of our moral life, and all these superior forms of psychical",Elementary Forms
41360,"activity which society awakens in us, these do not follow in the trail",Elementary Forms
41360,"of our bodily states, as our sensations and our general bodily",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness do. As we have already shown, this is because the world of",Elementary Forms
41360,representations in which social life passes is superimposed upon its,Elementary Forms
41360,"material substratum, far from arising from it; the determinism which",Elementary Forms
41360,reigns there is much more supple than the one whose roots are in the,Elementary Forms
41360,constitution of our tissues and it leaves with the actor a justified,Elementary Forms
41360,impression of the greatest liberty. The medium in which we thus move is,Elementary Forms
41360,"less opaque and less resistant: we feel ourselves to be, and we are,",Elementary Forms
41360,"more at our ease there. In a word, the only way we have of freeing",Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves from physical forces is to oppose them with collective forces.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But whatever we receive from society, we hold in common with our",Elementary Forms
41360,companions. So it is not at all true that we are more personal as we are,Elementary Forms
41360,more individualized. The two terms are in no way synonymous: in one,Elementary Forms
41360,"sense, they oppose more than they imply one another. Passion",Elementary Forms
41360,"individualizes, yet it also enslaves. Our sensations are essentially",Elementary Forms
41360,individual; yet we are more personal the more we are freed from our,Elementary Forms
41360,senses and able to think and act with concepts. So those who insist upon,Elementary Forms
41360,all the social elements of the individual do not mean by that to deny or,Elementary Forms
41360,debase the personality. They merely refuse to confuse it with the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,of individuation.[866],Elementary Forms

41360,"When we come to the idea of the soul, we have left the circle of purely",Elementary Forms
41360,impersonal forces. But above the soul the Australian religions already,Elementary Forms
41360,"recognize mythical personalities of a superior order: spirits,",Elementary Forms
41360,civilizing heroes and even gods who are properly so-called. While it,Elementary Forms
41360,"will be unnecessary to enter into the detail of the mythologies, we must",Elementary Forms
41360,at least seek the form in which these three categories of spiritual,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings are presented in Australia, and the way in which they are",Elementary Forms
41360,connected with the whole religious system.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"A soul is not a spirit. In fact, it is shut up in a determined organism;",Elementary Forms
41360,"though it may leave it at certain moments, it is ordinarily a prisoner",Elementary Forms
41360,"there. It definitely escapes only at death, and we have already seen the",Elementary Forms
41360,"difficulties under which the separation is accomplished. A spirit, on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, though often tied by the closest bonds to some particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"object, such as a spring, a rock, a tree, a star, etc., and though",Elementary Forms
41360,"residing there by preference, may go away at will and lead an",Elementary Forms
41360,independent existence in free space. So it has a more extended circle of,Elementary Forms
41360,action. It can act upon the individuals who approach it or whom it,Elementary Forms
41360,"approaches. The soul, on the contrary, has almost no influence except",Elementary Forms
41360,over the body it animates; it is very exceptional that it succeeds in,Elementary Forms
41360,influencing outside objects during the course of its terrestrial life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if the soul does not have the distinctive characteristics of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"spirit, it acquires them, at least in part, at death. In fact, when it",Elementary Forms
41360,"has been disincarnated, so long as it does not descend into a body",Elementary Forms
41360,"again, it has the same liberty of movement as a spirit. Of course, after",Elementary Forms
41360,"the rites of mourning have been accomplished, it is thought to go to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"land of souls, but before this it remains about the tomb for a rather",Elementary Forms
41360,"long time. Also, even after it has definitely departed, it is believed",Elementary Forms
41360,to prowl about in the brush near the camp.[867] It is generally,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented as a rather beneficent being, especially for the surviving",Elementary Forms
41360,members of its family; we have seen that the soul of the father comes to,Elementary Forms
41360,aid the growth of his children or his grandchildren. But it also happens,Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes that it shows signs of a veritable cruelty; everything depends,Elementary Forms
41360,upon its humour and the manner in which it is treated by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"living.[868] So it is recommended, especially to women and children, not",Elementary Forms
41360,to venture outside of the camp during the night so as not to expose,Elementary Forms
41360,oneself to dangerous encounters.[869],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, a ghost is not a real spirit. In the first place, it generally",Elementary Forms
41360,"has only a limited power of action; also, it does not have a definite",Elementary Forms
41360,"province. It is a vagabond, upon whom no determined task is incumbent,",Elementary Forms
41360,for the effect of death has been to put it outside of all regular forms;,Elementary Forms
41360,"as regards the living, it is a sort of a exile. A spirit, on the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, always has a power of a certain sort and it is by this that it is",Elementary Forms
41360,defined; it is set over a certain order of cosmic or social phenomena;,Elementary Forms
41360,it has a more or less precise function to fulfil in the system of the,Elementary Forms
41360,universe.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there are some souls which satisfy this double condition and which,Elementary Forms
41360,"are consequently spirits, in the proper sense of the word. These are the",Elementary Forms
41360,souls of the mythical personages whom popular imagination has placed at,Elementary Forms
41360,"the beginning of time, the Altjirangamitjina or the men of the",Elementary Forms
41360,Alcheringa among the Arunta; the Mura-mura among the tribes of Lake,Elementary Forms
41360,"Eyre; the Muk-Kurnai among the Kurnai, etc. In one sense, they are still",Elementary Forms
41360,"souls, for they are believed to have formerly animated bodies from which",Elementary Forms
41360,they separated themselves at a certain moment. But even when they led a,Elementary Forms
41360,"terrestrial life, they already had, as we have seen, exceptional powers;",Elementary Forms
41360,"they had a mana superior to that of ordinary men, and they have kept it.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, they are charged with definite functions.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, whether we accept the version of Spencer and Gillen",Elementary Forms
41360,"or that of Strehlow, it is to them that the care of assuring the",Elementary Forms
41360,periodical recruiting of the clan falls. They have charge of the,Elementary Forms
41360,phenomena of conception.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Even when the conception has been accomplished, the task of the ancestor",Elementary Forms
41360,is not yet completed. It is his duty to guard over the new-born child.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Later, when the child has become a man, he accompanies him in the hunt,",Elementary Forms
41360,"brings game to him, warns him by dreams of the dangers he may run,",Elementary Forms
41360,"protects him against his enemies, etc. On this point, Strehlow is",Elementary Forms
41360,entirely in accord with Spencer and Gillen.[870] It is true that someone,Elementary Forms
41360,"may ask how it is possible, according to the version of these latter,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the ancestor to fulfil this function; for, since he reincarnates",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself at the moment of conception, it seems as though he should be",Elementary Forms
41360,confounded with the soul of the child and should therefore be unable to,Elementary Forms
41360,protect it from without. But the fact is that he does not reincarnate,Elementary Forms
41360,himself entirely; he merely duplicates himself. One part of him enters,Elementary Forms
41360,the body of the woman and fertilizes her; another part continues to,Elementary Forms
41360,"exist outside and, under the special name of Arumburinga, fulfils the",Elementary Forms
41360,office of guardian genius.[871],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus we see how great a kinship there is between this ancestral spirit,Elementary Forms
41360,and the _genius_ of the Latins or the [Greek: daimon] of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Greeks.[872] The identification of function is complete. In fact, at",Elementary Forms
41360,"first the genius is the one who begets, _qui gignit_; he expresses and",Elementary Forms
41360,"personifies the powers of generation.[873] But at the same time, he is",Elementary Forms
41360,the protector and director of the particular individual to whose person,Elementary Forms
41360,he is attached.[874] He is finally confused with the personality itself,Elementary Forms
41360,of this individual; he represents the totality of the proclivities and,Elementary Forms
41360,tendencies which characterize him and give him a distinctive appearance,Elementary Forms
41360,among other men.[875] Hence come the well-known expressions _indulgere,Elementary Forms
41360,"genio_, _defraudere genium_ with the sense of _to follow one's natural",Elementary Forms
41360,"temperament_. At bottom, the _genius_ is another form or double of the",Elementary Forms
41360,soul of the individual. This is proved by the partial synonomy of,Elementary Forms
41360,_genius_ and _manes_.[876] The manes is the genius after death; but it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is also all that survives of the dead man, that is to say, his soul. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same way, the soul of the Arunta and the ancestral spirit which",Elementary Forms
41360,serves as his genius are only two different aspects of one and the same,Elementary Forms
41360,being.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is not only in relation to persons that the ancestor has a,Elementary Forms
41360,definite situation; he also has one in relation to things. Though he is,Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to have his real residence under the ground, they think that he",Elementary Forms
41360,"is always haunting the place where his nanja-tree or rock is, or the",Elementary Forms
41360,water-hole which was spontaneously formed at the exact spot where he,Elementary Forms
41360,"disappeared into the ground, having terminated his first existence. As",Elementary Forms
41360,"this tree or rock is believed to represent the body of the hero, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"imagine that the soul itself is constantly coming back there, and lives",Elementary Forms
41360,there more or less permanently; it is by the presence of this soul that,Elementary Forms
41360,they explain the religious respect inspired by these localities. No one,Elementary Forms
41360,can break the branch of a nanja-tree without a risk of falling,Elementary Forms
41360,"sick.[877] ""Formerly the act of breaking it down or injuring it was",Elementary Forms
41360,punished with death. An animal or bird taking refuge there could not be,Elementary Forms
41360,killed. Even the surrounding bushes had to be respected: the grass could,Elementary Forms
41360,"not be burned, the rocks also had to be treated with respect. It was",Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden to remove them or break them.""[878] As this sacred character",Elementary Forms
41360,"is attributed to the ancestor, he appears as the spirit of this tree or",Elementary Forms
41360,"rock, of this water-hole or spring.[879] If the spring is thought of as",Elementary Forms
41360,"having some connection with rain,[880] he will become a spirit of rain.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus, the same souls which serve as protecting geniuses for men also",Elementary Forms
41360,fulfil cosmic functions at the same time. It is undoubtedly in this,Elementary Forms
41360,sense that we must understand the text of Roth where he says that in,Elementary Forms
41360,"northern Queensland, the spirits of nature are the souls of the dead who",Elementary Forms
41360,have chosen to live in the forests or caves.[881],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So we have here some spiritual beings that are different from the,Elementary Forms
41360,wandering souls with no definite powers. Strehlow calls them gods;[882],Elementary Forms
41360,"but this expression is inexact, at least in the great majority of cases.",Elementary Forms
41360,"If it were true, then in a society like the Arunta where each one has",Elementary Forms
41360,"his protecting ancestor, there would be as many or more gods than there",Elementary Forms
41360,are individuals. It would merely introduce confusion into our,Elementary Forms
41360,terminology to give the name of god to a sacred being with only one,Elementary Forms
41360,"worshipper. It may be, of course, that the figure of the ancestor grows",Elementary Forms
41360,"to a point where it resembles a real divinity. Among the Warramunga, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"we have already pointed out,[883] the clan as a whole is thought to be",Elementary Forms
41360,descended from one sole and unique ancestor. It is easily seen how this,Elementary Forms
41360,"collective ancestor might, under certain circumstances, become the",Elementary Forms
41360,"object of a collective devotion. To choose a notable example, this is",Elementary Forms
41360,"what has happened to the snake Wollunqua.[884] This mythical beast, from",Elementary Forms
41360,"whom the clan of the same name is held to be descended, continues to",Elementary Forms
41360,"live, they believe, in water-holes which are therefore surrounded with",Elementary Forms
41360,a religious respect. Thus it becomes the object of a cult which the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrates collectively: through determined rites, they attempt to",Elementary Forms
41360,"please him and to win his favours, and they address to him all sorts of",Elementary Forms
41360,"prayers, etc. So we may say that he is like a god of the clan. But this",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a very exceptional case, or even, according to Spencer and Gillen, a",Elementary Forms
41360,"unique one. Normally, the word ""spirits"" is the only one suitable for",Elementary Forms
41360,designating these ancestral personages.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As to the manner in which this conception has been formed, we may say",Elementary Forms
41360,that it is evident from what has preceded.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As we have already shown, the existence of individual souls, when once",Elementary Forms
41360,"admitted, cannot be understood unless one imagines an original supply of",Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental souls at the origin of things, from which all the others",Elementary Forms
41360,were derived. Now these architype souls had to be conceived as,Elementary Forms
41360,"containing within them the source of all religious efficacy; for, since",Elementary Forms
41360,"the imagination does not go beyond them, it is from them and only from",Elementary Forms
41360,"them that all sacred things are believed to come, both the instruments",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the cult, the members of the clan and the animals of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,species. They incarnate all the sacredness diffused in the whole tribe,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the whole world, and so they are attributed powers noticeably",Elementary Forms
41360,"superior to those enjoyed by the simple souls of men. Moreover, time by",Elementary Forms
41360,itself increases and reinforces the sacred character of things. A very,Elementary Forms
41360,"ancient churinga inspires much more respect than a new one, and is",Elementary Forms
41360,supposed to have more virtues.[885] The sentiments of veneration of,Elementary Forms
41360,which it has been the object during the series of successive generations,Elementary Forms
41360,"who have handled it are, as it were, accumulated in it. For the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"reason, the personages who for centuries have been the subject of myths",Elementary Forms
41360,"respectfully passed on from mouth to mouth, and periodically put into",Elementary Forms
41360,"action by the rites, could not fail to take a very especial place in the",Elementary Forms
41360,popular imagination.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But how does it happen that, instead of remaining outside of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"organized society, they have become regular members of it?",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is because each individual is the double of an ancestor. Now when,Elementary Forms
41360,"two beings are related as closely as this, they are naturally conceived",Elementary Forms
41360,"as incorporated together; since they participate in the same nature, it",Elementary Forms
41360,seems as though that which affects one ought to affect the other as,Elementary Forms
41360,well. Thus the group of mythical ancestors became attached to the,Elementary Forms
41360,society of the living; the same interests and the same passions were,Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to each; they were regarded as associates. However, as the",Elementary Forms
41360,"former had a higher dignity than the latter, this association takes, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the public mind, the form of an agreement between superiors and",Elementary Forms
41360,"inferiors, between patrons and clients, benefactors and recipients. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,comes this curious idea of a protecting genius who is attached to each,Elementary Forms
41360,individual.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The question of how this ancestor came to have relations not only with,Elementary Forms
41360,"men, but also with things, may appear more embarrassing; for, at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first glance, we do not see what connection there can be between a",Elementary Forms
41360,personage of this sort and a rock or tree. But a fact which we owe to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow furnishes us with a solution of this problem, which is at least",Elementary Forms
41360,probable.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These trees and rocks are not situated at any point in the tribal,Elementary Forms
41360,"territory, but, for the most part, they are grouped around the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sanctuaries, called ertnatulunga by Spencer and Gillen and arknanaua by",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow, where the churinga of the clan is kept.[886] We know the",Elementary Forms
41360,respect with which these localities are enhaloed from the mere fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,the most precious instruments of the cult are there. Each of these,Elementary Forms
41360,spreads sanctity all about it. It is for this reason that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"neighbouring trees and rocks appear sacred, that it is forbidden to",Elementary Forms
41360,"destroy or harm them, and that all violence used against them is a",Elementary Forms
41360,sacrilege. This sacred character is really due to a simple phenomenon of,Elementary Forms
41360,"psychic contagiousness; but in order to explain it, the native must",Elementary Forms
41360,admit that these different objects have relations with the different,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings in whom he sees the source of all religious power, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, with the ancestors of the Alcheringa. Hence comes the system of",Elementary Forms
41360,myths of which we have spoken. They imagined that each ertnatulunga,Elementary Forms
41360,marked the spot where a group of ancestors entered into the ground. The,Elementary Forms
41360,mounds or trees which covered the ground were believed to represent,Elementary Forms
41360,"their bodies. But as the soul retains, in a general way, a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,"affinity for the body in which it dwelt, they were naturally led to",Elementary Forms
41360,believe that these ancestral souls continued to frequent these places,Elementary Forms
41360,where their material envelope remained. So they were located in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rocks, the trees or the water-holes. Thus each of them, though remaining",Elementary Forms
41360,"attached to some determined individual, became transformed into a sort",Elementary Forms
41360,of _genius loci_ and fulfilled its functions.[887],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The conceptions thus elucidated enable us to understand a form of,Elementary Forms
41360,totemism which we have left unexplained up to the present: this is,Elementary Forms
41360,individual totemism.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"An individual totem is defined, in its essence, by the two following",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristics: (1) it is a being in an animal or vegetable form whose,Elementary Forms
41360,function is to protect an individual; (2) the fate of this individual,Elementary Forms
41360,and that of his patron are closely united: all that touches the latter,Elementary Forms
41360,is sympathetically communicated to the former. Now the ancestral spirits,Elementary Forms
41360,of which we have just been speaking answer to this same definition. They,Elementary Forms
41360,"also belong, at least in part, to the animal or vegetable kingdoms.",Elementary Forms
41360,"They, too, are protecting geniuses. Finally, a sympathetic bond unites",Elementary Forms
41360,"each individual to his protecting ancestor. In fact, the nanja-tree,",Elementary Forms
41360,"representing the mystical body of this ancestor, cannot be destroyed",Elementary Forms
41360,without the man's feeling himself menaced. It is true that this belief,Elementary Forms
41360,"is losing its force to-day, but Spencer and Gillen have observed it, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"in any case, they are of the opinion that formerly it was quite",Elementary Forms
41360,general.[888],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The identity of these two conceptions is found even in their details.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The ancestral souls reside in trees or rocks which are considered,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred. Likewise, among the Euahlayi, the spirit of the animal serving",Elementary Forms
41360,as individual totem is believed to inhabit a tree or stone.[889] This,Elementary Forms
41360,tree or stone is sacred; no one may touch it except the proprietor of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totem; when it is a stone or rock, this interdiction is still",Elementary Forms
41360,absolute.[890] The result is that they are veritable places of refuge.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, we have seen that the individual soul is only another aspect of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ancestral spirit, according to Strehlow, this serves after a",Elementary Forms
41360,"fashion, as a second self.[891] Likewise, following an expression of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Mrs. Parker, the individual totem of the Euahlayi, called Yunbeai, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"the _alter ego_ of the individual: ""The soul of a man is in his Yunbeai",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the soul of his Yunbeai is in him.""[892] So at bottom, it is one",Elementary Forms
41360,soul in two bodies. The kinship of these two notions is so close that,Elementary Forms
41360,they are sometimes expressed by one and the same word. This is the case,Elementary Forms
41360,"in Melanesia and in Polynesia: _atai_ in the island Mota, _tamaniu_ in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the island Aurora, and _talegia_ in Motlaw all designate both the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,of the individual and his personal totem.[893] It is the same with,Elementary Forms
41360,_aitu_ in Samoa.[894] This is because the individual totem is merely,Elementary Forms
41360,"the outward and visible form of the ego or the personality, of which the",Elementary Forms
41360,soul is the inward and invisible form.[895],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the individual totem has all the essential characteristics of the,Elementary Forms
41360,protecting ancestor and fills the same role: this is because it has the,Elementary Forms
41360,same origin and proceeds from the same idea.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Each of them, in fact, consists in a duplication of the soul. The totem,",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the ancestor, is the soul of the individual, but externalized and",Elementary Forms
41360,invested with powers superior to those it is believed to possess while,Elementary Forms
41360,within the organism. Now this duplication is the result of a,Elementary Forms
41360,psychological necessity; for it only expresses the nature of the soul,Elementary Forms
41360,"which, as we have seen, is double. In one sense, it is ours: it",Elementary Forms
41360,"expresses our personality. But at the same time, it is outside of us,",Elementary Forms
41360,for it is only the reaching into us of a religious force which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"outside of us. We cannot confound ourselves with it completely, for we",Elementary Forms
41360,attribute to it an excellence and a dignity by which it rises far above,Elementary Forms
41360,us and our empirical individuality. So there is a whole part of,Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves which we tend to project into the outside. This way of,Elementary Forms
41360,thinking of ourselves is so well established in our nature that we,Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot escape it, even when we attempt to regard ourselves without",Elementary Forms
41360,having recourse to any religious symbols. Our moral consciousness is,Elementary Forms
41360,like a nucleus about which the idea of the soul forms itself; yet when,Elementary Forms
41360,"it speaks to us, it gives the effect of an outside power, superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,"us, which gives us our law and judges us, but which also aids and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sustains us. When we have it on our side, we feel ourselves to be",Elementary Forms
41360,"stronger against the trials of life, and better assured of triumphing",Elementary Forms
41360,"over them, just as the Australian who, when trusting in his ancestor or",Elementary Forms
41360,"his personal totem, feels himself more valiant against his enemies.[896]",Elementary Forms
41360,"So there is something objective at the basis of these conceptions,",Elementary Forms
41360,"whether we have in mind the Roman _genius_, the individual totem, or the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Alcheringa ancestor; and this is why they have survived, in various",Elementary Forms
41360,"forms, up to the present day. Everything goes just as if we really had",Elementary Forms
41360,"two souls; one which is within us, or rather, which is us; the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is above us, and whose function it is to control and assist the",Elementary Forms
41360,first one. Frazer thought that the individual totem was an external,Elementary Forms
41360,soul; but he believed that this exteriority was the result of an,Elementary Forms
41360,"artifice and a magic ruse. In reality, it is implied in the very",Elementary Forms
41360,constitution of the idea of the soul.[897],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The spirits of which we have just been speaking are essentially,Elementary Forms
41360,benefactors. Of course they punish a man if he does not treat them in a,Elementary Forms
41360,fitting manner;[898] but it is not their function to work evil.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, a spirit is in itself just as capable of doing evil as good.",Elementary Forms
41360,"This is why we find a class of evil geniuses forming itself naturally,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in opposition to these auxiliary and protecting spirits, which enables",Elementary Forms
41360,"men to explain the permanent evils that they have to suffer, their",Elementary Forms
41360,"nightmares[899] and illnesses,[900] whirlwinds and tempests,[901] etc.",Elementary Forms
41360,Of course this is not saying that all these human miseries have appeared,Elementary Forms
41360,as things too abnormal to be explained in any way except by supernatural,Elementary Forms
41360,forces; but it is saying that these forces are thought of under a,Elementary Forms
41360,religious form. As it is a religious principle which is considered the,Elementary Forms
41360,"source of life, so, all the events which disturb or destroy life ought",Elementary Forms
41360,logically to be traced to a principle of the same sort.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These harmful spirits seem to have been conceived on the same model as,Elementary Forms
41360,the good spirits of which we have just been speaking. They are,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented in an animal form, or one that is half-animal,",Elementary Forms
41360,half-man;[902] but men are naturally inclined to give them enormous,Elementary Forms
41360,"dimensions and a repulsive aspect.[903] Like the souls of the ancestors,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are believed to inhabit trees, rocks, water-holes and subterranean",Elementary Forms
41360,"caverns.[904] Taking the Arunta as a particular example, Spencer and",Elementary Forms
41360,"Gillen say expressly that these evil geniuses, known under the name of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Oruncha, are beings of the Alcheringa.[905] Many are represented as the",Elementary Forms
41360,souls of persons who had led a terrestrial life.[906] Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"personages of the fabulous epoch, there were, in fact, many different",Elementary Forms
41360,temperaments: some had cruel and evil instincts which they,Elementary Forms
41360,retained;[907] others were naturally of a bad constitution; they were,Elementary Forms
41360,"thin and emaciated; so after they had entered into the ground, the nanja",Elementary Forms
41360,rocks to which they gave birth were considered the homes of dangerous,Elementary Forms
41360,influences.[908],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Yet they are distinguished by special characteristics from their,Elementary Forms
41360,"confreres, the heroes of the Alcheringa. They do not reincarnate",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves; among living men, there is no one who represents them; they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are without human posterity.[909] When, judging from certain signs, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"believe that a child is the result of their work, it is put to death as",Elementary Forms
41360,"soon as born.[910] Also, these belong to no determined totemic group;",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are outside the social organization.[911] By all these traits, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are recognized as magic powers rather than religious ones. And in fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is especially with the magician that they have relations; very,Elementary Forms
41360,frequently it is from them that he gets his powers.[912] So we have now,Elementary Forms
41360,arrived at the point where the world of religion stops and that of magic,Elementary Forms
41360,"commences; and as this latter is outside the field of our research, we",Elementary Forms
41360,need not push our researches further.[913],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The appearance of the notion of spirits marks an important step in,Elementary Forms
41360,advance in the individualization of religious forces.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, the spiritual beings of whom we have been speaking up to the",Elementary Forms
41360,present are as yet only secondary personages. They are either,Elementary Forms
41360,"evil-working geniuses who belong to magic rather than religion, or else,",Elementary Forms
41360,"being attached to determined individuals or places, they cannot make",Elementary Forms
41360,their influence felt except within a circle of a very limited radius. So,Elementary Forms
41360,they can only be the objects of private and local rites. But after the,Elementary Forms
41360,"idea has once been established, it naturally spreads to the higher",Elementary Forms
41360,"spheres of the religious life, and thus mythical personalities of a",Elementary Forms
41360,superior order are born.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Though the ceremonies of the different clans differ from one another,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they all belong to the same religion, none the less; also, a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,number of essential similarities exist between them. Since all the clans,Elementary Forms
41360,"are only parts of one and the same tribe, the unity of the tribe cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,fail to make itself felt through this diversity of particular cults. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, there is no totemic group that does not have churinga and",Elementary Forms
41360,"bull-roarers, and these are used everywhere in the same way. The",Elementary Forms
41360,"organization of the tribe into phratries, matrimonial classes and clans,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the exogamic interdictions attached to them, are veritable tribal",Elementary Forms
41360,institutions. The initiation celebrations all include certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental practices, the extraction of a tooth, circumcision,",Elementary Forms
41360,"subincision, etc., which do not vary with the totems within a single",Elementary Forms
41360,tribe. The uniformity on this point is the more easily established as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the initiation always takes place in the presence of the tribe, or at",Elementary Forms
41360,"least, before an assembly to which the different clans have been",Elementary Forms
41360,summoned. The reason for this is that the object of the initiation is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"introduce the neophyte into the religious life, not merely of the clan",Elementary Forms
41360,"into which he was born, but of the tribe as a whole; so it is necessary",Elementary Forms
41360,that the various aspects of the tribal religion be represented before,Elementary Forms
41360,"him and take place, in a way, under his very eyes. It is on this",Elementary Forms
41360,occasion that the moral and religious unity of the tribe is affirmed the,Elementary Forms
41360,best.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus, in each society there are a certain number of rites which are",Elementary Forms
41360,distinguished from all the others by their homogeneity and their,Elementary Forms
41360,generality. So noticeably a harmony seemed to be explicable only by a,Elementary Forms
41360,unity of origin. So they imagined that each group of similar rites had,Elementary Forms
41360,"been founded by one and the same ancestor, who came to reveal them to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the tribe as a whole. Thus, among the Arunta, it was an ancestor of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Wild Cat clan, named Putiaputia,[914] who is thought to have taught men",Elementary Forms
41360,"the way of making churinga and using it ritually; among the Warramunga,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it was Murtu-murtu;[915] among the Urabunna, Witurna;[916] it was Atnatu",Elementary Forms
41360,"among the Kaitish[917] and Tendun among the Kurnai.[918] Likewise, the",Elementary Forms
41360,practice of circumcision is attributed by the eastern Dieri and many,Elementary Forms
41360,"other tribes[919] to two special Muramura, and by the Arunta to a hero",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the Alcheringa, of the Lizard totem, named Mangarkunjerkunja.[920] To",Elementary Forms
41360,this same personage are ascribed the foundation of the matrimonial,Elementary Forms
41360,"institutions and the social organization they imply, the discovery of",Elementary Forms
41360,"fire, the invention of the spear, the buckler, the boomerang, etc. It",Elementary Forms
41360,also happens very frequently that the inventor of the bull-roarer is,Elementary Forms
41360,also considered the founder of the rites of initiation.[921],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These special ancestors cannot be put in the same rank as the others. On,Elementary Forms
41360,"the one hand, the sentiments of veneration which they inspire are not",Elementary Forms
41360,"limited to one clan, but are common to the whole tribe. On the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"hand, it is to them that men ascribe all that is most esteemed in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"tribal civilization. For this double reason, they became the object of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"special consideration. For example, they say of Atnatu that he was born",Elementary Forms
41360,"in heaven at an epoch even prior to the times of the Alcheringa, that he",Elementary Forms
41360,made himself and that he gave himself the name he bears. The stars are,Elementary Forms
41360,"his wives and daughters. Beyond the heaven where he lives, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,"another one with another sun. His name is sacred, and should never be",Elementary Forms
41360,pronounced before women or non-initiated persons.[922],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Yet, howsoever great the prestige enjoyed by these personages may be,",Elementary Forms
41360,there was no occasion for founding special rites in their honour; for,Elementary Forms
41360,they themselves are only rites personified. They have no other reason,Elementary Forms
41360,for existence than to explain existing practices; they are only another,Elementary Forms
41360,aspect of these. The churinga and the ancestor who invented it are only,Elementary Forms
41360,"one; sometimes, both have the same name.[923] When someone makes the",Elementary Forms
41360,"bull-roarer resound, they say that it is the voice of the ancestor",Elementary Forms
41360,"making himself heard.[924] But, for the very reason that each of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"heroes is confounded with the cult he is believed to have founded, they",Elementary Forms
41360,believe that he is attentive to the way in which it is celebrated. He is,Elementary Forms
41360,not satisfied unless the worshippers fulfil their duties exactly; he,Elementary Forms
41360,punishes those who are negligent.[925] So he is thought of as the,Elementary Forms
41360,"guardian of the rite, as well as its founder, and for this reason, he",Elementary Forms
41360,becomes invested with a veritable moral role.[926],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, this mythological formation is not the highest which is to be",Elementary Forms
41360,found among the Australians. There are at least a certain number of,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribes who have arrived at a conception of a god who, if not unique, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"at least supreme, and to whom is attributed a pre-eminent position among",Elementary Forms
41360,all the other religious entities.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The existence of this belief was pointed out long ago by different,Elementary Forms
41360,observers;[927] but it is Howitt who has contributed the most to,Elementary Forms
41360,"establishing its relative generality. In fact, he has verified it over a",Elementary Forms
41360,very extended geographical area embracing the State of Victoria and New,Elementary Forms
41360,South Wales and even extending up to Queensland.[928] In all this entire,Elementary Forms
41360,"region, a considerable number of tribes believe in the existence of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"veritable tribal divinity, who has different names, according to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"district. The ones most frequently employed are Bunjil or Punjil,[929]",Elementary Forms
41360,Daramulun[930] and Baiame.[931] But we also find Nuralie or,Elementary Forms
41360,"Nurelle,[932] Kohin[933] and Mangan-ngaua.[934] The same conception is",Elementary Forms
41360,"found again farther west, among the Narrinyeri, where the great god is",Elementary Forms
41360,"called Nurunderi or Ngurrunderi.[935] Among the Dieri, it is probable",Elementary Forms
41360,"that there is one of the Mura-mura, or ordinary ancestors, who enjoys a",Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of supremacy over the others.[936] Finally, in opposition to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"affirmations of Spencer and Gillen, who declare that they have observed",Elementary Forms
41360,"no belief in a real divinity among the Arunta,[937] Strehlow assures us",Elementary Forms
41360,"that this people, as well as the Loritja, recognize, under the name",Elementary Forms
41360,"Altjira, a veritable ""good god.""[938]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The essential characteristics of this personage are the same everywhere.,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is an immortal, and even an eternal being, for it was not derived",Elementary Forms
41360,from any other. After having lived on earth for a certain length of,Elementary Forms
41360,"time, he ascended to heaven, or else was taken up there,[939] and",Elementary Forms
41360,"continues to live there, surrounded by his family, for generally he is",Elementary Forms
41360,"said to have one or several wives, children and brothers,[940] who",Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes assist him in his functions. Under the pretext of a visit he,Elementary Forms
41360,"is said to have made to them, he and his family are frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"identified with certain stars.[941] Moreover, they attribute to him a",Elementary Forms
41360,power over stars. It is he who regulates the journey of the sun and,Elementary Forms
41360,moon;[942] he gives them orders.[943] It is he who makes the lightning,Elementary Forms
41360,leap from the clouds and who throws the thunder-bolts.[944] Since he is,Elementary Forms
41360,"the thunder, he is also connected with the rain:[945] it is to him that",Elementary Forms
41360,"men address themselves when there is a scarcity of water, or when too",Elementary Forms
41360,much falls.[946],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,They speak of him as a sort of creator: he is called the father of men,Elementary Forms
41360,and they say that he made them. According to a legend current around,Elementary Forms
41360,"Melbourne, Bunjil made the first man in the following manner. He made a",Elementary Forms
41360,"little statue out of white clay; then, after he had danced all around it",Elementary Forms
41360,"several times and had breathed into its nostrils, the statue became",Elementary Forms
41360,"animated and commenced to walk about.[947] According to another myth, he",Elementary Forms
41360,lighted the sun; thus the earth became heated and men came out of,Elementary Forms
41360,"it.[948] At the same time that he made men,[949] this divine personage",Elementary Forms
41360,made the animals and trees;[950] it is to him that men owe all the arts,Elementary Forms
41360,"of life, arms, language and tribal rites.[951] He is the benefactor of",Elementary Forms
41360,"humanity. Even yet, he plays the role of a sort of providence for them.",Elementary Forms
41360,It is he who supplies his worshippers with all that is necessary for,Elementary Forms
41360,"their existence.[952] He is in communication with them, either directly",Elementary Forms
41360,or through intermediaries.[953] But being at the same time guardian of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the morals of the tribe, he treats them severely when these are",Elementary Forms
41360,"violated.[954] If we are to believe certain observers, he will even",Elementary Forms
41360,"fulfil the office of judge, after this life; he will separate the good",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the bad, and will not reward the ones like the others.[955] In any",Elementary Forms
41360,"case, they are often represented as ruling the land of the dead,[956]",Elementary Forms
41360,and as gathering the souls together when they arrive in the,Elementary Forms
41360,beyond.[957],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As the initiation is the principal form of the tribal cult, it is to the",Elementary Forms
41360,rites of initiation that he is attached especially; he is their centre.,Elementary Forms
41360,He is very frequently represented by an image cut on a piece of bark or,Elementary Forms
41360,soaked into the ground. They dance around it; they sing in its honour;,Elementary Forms
41360,they even address real prayers to it.[958] They explain to the young men,Elementary Forms
41360,who the personage is whom this image represents; they tell them his,Elementary Forms
41360,"secret name, which the women and the uninitiated cannot know; they",Elementary Forms
41360,relate to them his history and the part attributed to him in the life of,Elementary Forms
41360,the tribe. At other times they raise their hands towards the heaven,Elementary Forms
41360,"where he is thought to dwell, or else they point their arms or the",Elementary Forms
41360,ritual instruments they have in hand in this direction;[959] this is a,Elementary Forms
41360,way of entering into communication with him. They feel his presence,Elementary Forms
41360,everywhere. He watches over the neophyte when he has withdrawn into the,Elementary Forms
41360,forest.[960] He is attentive to the manner in which the ceremonies are,Elementary Forms
41360,celebrated. The initiation is his cult. So he gives special attention to,Elementary Forms
41360,seeing that these are carried out exactly: if there are any faults or,Elementary Forms
41360,"negligences, he punishes them in a terrible manner.[961]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the authority of each of these supreme gods is not limited to",Elementary Forms
41360,a single tribe; it is recognized equally by a number of neighbouring,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribes. Bunjil is adored in nearly all of Victoria, Baiame in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"considerable portion of New South Wales, etc.; this is why there are so",Elementary Forms
41360,few gods for a relatively extended geographical area. So the cults of,Elementary Forms
41360,which they are the object have an international character. It even,Elementary Forms
41360,"happens sometimes that mythologies intermingle, combine and make mutual",Elementary Forms
41360,borrowings. Thus the majority of the tribes who believe in Baiame also,Elementary Forms
41360,"admit the existence of Daramulun; however, they accord him a slighter",Elementary Forms
41360,"dignity. They make him a son or brother of Baiame, and subordinate to",Elementary Forms
41360,this latter.[962] Thus the faith in Daramulun has spread in diverse,Elementary Forms
41360,"forms, into all of New South Wales. So it is far from true that",Elementary Forms
41360,religious internationalism is a peculiarity of the most recent and,Elementary Forms
41360,"advanced religions. From the dawn of history, religious beliefs have",Elementary Forms
41360,manifested a tendency to overflow out of one strictly limited political,Elementary Forms
41360,society; it is as though they had a natural aptitude for crossing,Elementary Forms
41360,"frontiers, and for diffusing and internationalizing themselves. Of",Elementary Forms
41360,course there have been peoples and times when this spontaneous aptitude,Elementary Forms
41360,has been held in check by opposed social necessities; but that does not,Elementary Forms
41360,"keep it from being real and, as we see, very primitive.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,To Tylor this conception has appeared to be a part of so elevated a,Elementary Forms
41360,theology that he refuses to see in it anything but the product of a,Elementary Forms
41360,European importation: he would have it be a more or less denatured,Elementary Forms
41360,"Christian idea.[963] Andrew Lang, on the contrary, considers them",Elementary Forms
41360,autochthonous;[964] but as he also admits that it is contrasted with all,Elementary Forms
41360,the other Australian beliefs and rests on completely different,Elementary Forms
41360,"principles, he concludes that the religions of Australia are made up of",Elementary Forms
41360,"two heterogeneous systems, superimposed one upon the other, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently derived from a double origin. On the one hand, there were",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas relative to totems and spirits, which had been suggested to men by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the sight of certain natural phenomena. But at the same time, by a sort",Elementary Forms
41360,of intuition as to the nature of which he refuses to make himself,Elementary Forms
41360,"clear,[965] the human intelligence succeeded at the first onset in",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceiving a unique god, creator of the world and legislator of the",Elementary Forms
41360,moral order. Lang even estimates that this idea was purer of foreign,Elementary Forms
41360,"elements at the beginning, and especially in Australia, than in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"civilizations which immediately followed. With time, it was covered over",Elementary Forms
41360,and obscured little by little by the ever-growing mass of animistic and,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic superstitions. Thus it underwent a sort of progressive,Elementary Forms
41360,"degeneration up to the day when, as the effect of a privileged culture,",Elementary Forms
41360,it succeeded in coming into its own and restated itself again with more,Elementary Forms
41360,force and clarity than it had in the first place.[966],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the facts allow neither the sceptical hypothesis of Tylor nor the,Elementary Forms
41360,theological interpretation of Lang.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, it is certain to-day that the ideas relative to the",Elementary Forms
41360,great tribal god are of indigenous origin. They were observed before,Elementary Forms
41360,the influence of the missionaries had as yet had time to make itself,Elementary Forms
41360,felt.[967] But it does not follow that it is necessary to attribute them,Elementary Forms
41360,to a mysterious revelation. Far from being derived from a different,Elementary Forms
41360,"source than the regular totemic beliefs, they are, on the contrary, only",Elementary Forms
41360,the logical working-out of these beliefs and their highest form.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have already seen how the notion of mythical ancestors is implied in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the very principles upon which totemism rests, for each of them is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic being. Now, though the great gods are certainly superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,"these, still, there are only differences of degree between them; we pass",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the first to the second with no break of continuity. In fact, a",Elementary Forms
41360,great god is himself an ancestor of especial importance. They frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,"speak to us about him as though he were a man, endowed, to be sure, with",Elementary Forms
41360,"more than human powers, but one who lived a human life upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"earth.[968] He is pictured as a great hunter,[969] a powerful",Elementary Forms
41360,"magician,[970] or the founder of the tribe.[971] He was the first",Elementary Forms
41360,man.[972] One legend even represents him in the form of a worn-out old,Elementary Forms
41360,man who could hardly move about.[973] If a supreme god named Mura-mura,Elementary Forms
41360,"has existed among the Dieri, the very word is significant, for it serves",Elementary Forms
41360,"to designate the class of the ancestors. Likewise, Nuralie, the name of",Elementary Forms
41360,"a great god among the tribes on the Murray River, is sometimes used as a",Elementary Forms
41360,collective expression which is applied to the group of mythical beings,Elementary Forms
41360,whom tradition places at the origin of things.[974] They are personages,Elementary Forms
41360,"wholly comparable to those of the Alcheringa.[975] In Queensland, we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have already met with a god Anjea or Anjir, who made men but who seems,",Elementary Forms
41360,"nevertheless, to be only the first man.[976]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A fact that has aided Australian thought to pass from the numerous,Elementary Forms
41360,ancestral geniuses to the idea of the tribal god is that between the two,Elementary Forms
41360,"extremes a middle term has been inserted, which has served as a",Elementary Forms
41360,transition: these are the civilizing heroes. The fabulous beings whom we,Elementary Forms
41360,call by this name are really simple ancestors to whom mythology has,Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed an eminent place in the history of the tribe, and whom it",Elementary Forms
41360,"has, for this reason, set above the others. We have even seen that they",Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily form a part of the totemic organization: Mangarkunjerkunja,Elementary Forms
41360,belongs to the Lizard totem and Putiaputia to the Wild Cat totem. But on,Elementary Forms
41360,"the other hand, the functions which they are believed to fulfil, or to",Elementary Forms
41360,"have fulfilled, are closely similar to those incumbent upon a great god.",Elementary Forms
41360,"He, too, is believed to have introduced the arts of civilization among",Elementary Forms
41360,"men, to have been the founder of the principal social institutions and",Elementary Forms
41360,the revealer of the great religious ceremonies which still remain under,Elementary Forms
41360,"his control. If he is the father of men, it is because he manufactured",Elementary Forms
41360,them rather than begat them: but Mangarkunjerkunja also made them.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Before his time, there were no men, but only unformed masses of flesh,",Elementary Forms
41360,in which the different members and even the different individuals were,Elementary Forms
41360,not yet separated from one another. It was he who cut up this original,Elementary Forms
41360,matter and made real human beings out of it.[977] Between this mode of,Elementary Forms
41360,"fabrication and the one the myth we have spoken of attributes to Bunjil,",Elementary Forms
41360,"there are only shades of difference. Moreover, the bonds uniting these",Elementary Forms
41360,two sorts of figures to each other are well shown by the fact that a,Elementary Forms
41360,relationship of descent is sometimes established between them. Among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Kurnai, the hero of the bull-roarer, Tundun, is the son of the great god",Elementary Forms
41360,"Mungan-ngaua.[978] Likewise, among the Euahlayi, Daramulun, the son or",Elementary Forms
41360,"brother of Baiame, is identical with Gayandi who is the equivalent of",Elementary Forms
41360,the Tundun of the Kurnai.[979] Of course it is not necessary to conclude,Elementary Forms
41360,from these facts that the great god is nothing more than a civilizing,Elementary Forms
41360,hero. There are cases where these two personages are carefully,Elementary Forms
41360,"differentiated. But if they are not confounded, they are at least",Elementary Forms
41360,relatives. So it sometimes happens that we find it hard to distinguish,Elementary Forms
41360,them; there are some who could be classified equally well in one,Elementary Forms
41360,"category or the other. Thus, we have spoken of Atnatu as a civilizing",Elementary Forms
41360,hero; but he comes very near to being a great god.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The notion of a supreme god even depends so closely upon the entire,Elementary Forms
41360,system of the totemic beliefs that it still bears their mark. Tundun is,Elementary Forms
41360,"a divine hero, as we have just seen, who is very close to the tribal",Elementary Forms
41360,"divinity; now among the Kurnai, the same word means totem.[980]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Similarly, among the Arunta, Altjira is the name of a great god; it is",Elementary Forms
41360,also the name of the maternal totem.[981] But there is more to be said,Elementary Forms
41360,than this; many great gods have an obviously totemic aspect. Daramulun,Elementary Forms
41360,"is an eagle-hawk;[982] his mother, an emu.[983] It is also under the",Elementary Forms
41360,features of an emu that Baiame is represented.[984] The Altjira of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Arunta has the legs of an emu.[985] Before being the name of a great,Elementary Forms
41360,"god, Nuralie designated, as we just saw, the ancestor-founders of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"tribe; now some of these were crows, the others hawks.[986] According to",Elementary Forms
41360,"Howitt,[987] Bunjil is always represented in a human form; however, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same word serves to designate the totem of a phratry, the eagle-hawk. At",Elementary Forms
41360,least one of his sons is among the totems included in the phratry to,Elementary Forms
41360,"which he has given, or from which he has taken his name.[988] His",Elementary Forms
41360,"brother is Pallyan, the bat; now this latter serves as sexual totem for",Elementary Forms
41360,the men in many tribes in Victoria.[989],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We can even go farther and state more definitely the connection which,Elementary Forms
41360,these great gods have with the totemic system. We have just seen that,Elementary Forms
41360,"Bunjil is the totem of a phratry. Daramulun, like Bunjil, is an",Elementary Forms
41360,"eagle-hawk, and we know that this bird is the totem of phratries in a",Elementary Forms
41360,large number of south-eastern tribes.[990] We have already pointed out,Elementary Forms
41360,that Nuralie seems to have originally been a collective term designating,Elementary Forms
41360,indistinctly either eagle-hawks or crows; now in the tribes where this,Elementary Forms
41360,"myth has been observed, the crow is the totem of one of the two",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratries, the eagle-hawk, that of the other.[991] Also, the legendary",Elementary Forms
41360,history of the great gods resembles that of the totems of the phratries,Elementary Forms
41360,"very closely. The myths, and sometimes the rites, commemorate the",Elementary Forms
41360,struggles which each of these divinities fought against a carnivorous,Elementary Forms
41360,"bird, over which it triumphed only with the greatest difficulty. Bunjil,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the first man, after making the second man, Karween, entered into a",Elementary Forms
41360,"conflict with him, and in the course of a sort of duel, he wounded him",Elementary Forms
41360,severely and changed him into a crow.[992] The two species of Nurtalie,Elementary Forms
41360,are represented as two hostile groups which were originally in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"constant state of war.[993] Baiame, on his side, had to fight against",Elementary Forms
41360,"Mullian, the cannibal eagle-hawk, who, by the way, is identical with",Elementary Forms
41360,"Daramulun.[994] Now, as we have seen, there is also a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,constitutional hostility between the totems of the phratries. This,Elementary Forms
41360,parallelism completes the proof that the mythology of the great gods and,Elementary Forms
41360,that of these totems are closely related. This relationship will appear,Elementary Forms
41360,still more evident if we notice that the rival of the god is regularly,Elementary Forms
41360,"either a crow or an eagle-hawk, and that these are quite generally the",Elementary Forms
41360,totems of the phratries.[995],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So Baiame, Daramulun, Nuralie and Bunjil seem to be phratry-totems who",Elementary Forms
41360,have been deified; and we may imagine that this apotheosis took place as,Elementary Forms
41360,follows. It is obviously in the assemblies which take place in regard to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the initiation that the conception was elaborated, for the great gods do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not play a role of any importance except in these rites, and are",Elementary Forms
41360,"strangers to the other religious ceremonies. Moreover, as the initiation",Elementary Forms
41360,"is the principal form of the tribal cult, it is only on this occasion",Elementary Forms
41360,that a tribal mythology could arise. We have already seen how the,Elementary Forms
41360,rituals of circumcision and subincision spontaneously tend to personify,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves under the form of civilizing heroes. However, these heroes",Elementary Forms
41360,exercised no supremacy; they were on the same footing as the other,Elementary Forms
41360,legendary benefactors of society. But wherever the tribe acquired a,Elementary Forms
41360,"livelier sentiment of itself, this sentiment naturally incarnated itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"in some personage, who became its symbol. In order to account for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"bonds uniting them to one another, no matter what clan they belonged to,",Elementary Forms
41360,men imagined that they were all descended from the same stock and that,Elementary Forms
41360,"they were all descended from a single father, to whom they owe their",Elementary Forms
41360,"existence, though he owed his to no one. The god of the initiation was",Elementary Forms
41360,"predestined to this role, for, according to an expression frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"coming to the lips of the natives, the object of the initiation is to",Elementary Forms
41360,make or manufacture men. So they attributed a creative power to this,Elementary Forms
41360,"god, and for all these reasons, he found himself invested with a",Elementary Forms
41360,prestige setting him well above the other heroes of the mythology. These,Elementary Forms
41360,"others became his auxiliaries, subordinate to him; they were made his",Elementary Forms
41360,"sons or younger brothers, as was the case with Tundun, Gayandi,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Karween, Pallyan, etc. But other sacred beings already existed, who",Elementary Forms
41360,occupied an equally eminent place in the religious system of the clan:,Elementary Forms
41360,"these were the totems of the phratries. Wherever these are maintained,",Elementary Forms
41360,they are believed to keep the totems of the clans dependent upon them.,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus they had all that was necessary for becoming tribal divinities,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves. So it was only natural that a partial confusion should arise,Elementary Forms
41360,between these two sorts of mythical beings; it is thus that one of the,Elementary Forms
41360,two fundamental totems of the tribe gave his traits to the great god.,Elementary Forms
41360,But as it was necessary to explain why only one of them was called to,Elementary Forms
41360,"this dignity and the other excluded, they supposed that this latter, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the course of a fight against his rival, was vanquished and that his",Elementary Forms
41360,exclusion was the consequence of his defeat. This theory was the more,Elementary Forms
41360,readily admitted because it was in accord with the rest of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mythology, where the totems of the phratries are generally considered",Elementary Forms
41360,enemies of one another.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A myth observed by Mrs. Parker among the Euahlayi[996] may serve to,Elementary Forms
41360,"confirm this explanation, for it merely translates it into figurative",Elementary Forms
41360,"language. It is related that in this tribe, the totems were only the",Elementary Forms
41360,names given to the different parts of Baiame's body at first. So the,Elementary Forms
41360,"clans were, in a sense, the fragments of the divine body. Now is this",Elementary Forms
41360,not just another way of saying that the great god is the synthesis of,Elementary Forms
41360,all the totems and consequently the personification of the tribal unity?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But at the same time, it takes an international character. In fact, the",Elementary Forms
41360,members of the tribe to which the young initiates belong are not the,Elementary Forms
41360,only ones who assist at the ceremonies of initiation; representatives,Elementary Forms
41360,from the neighbouring tribes are specially summoned to these,Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrations, which thus become sorts of international fairs, at once",Elementary Forms
41360,religious and laical.[997] Beliefs elaborated in social environments,Elementary Forms
41360,thus constituted could not remain the exclusive patrimony of any special,Elementary Forms
41360,nationality. The stranger to whom they are revealed carries them back to,Elementary Forms
41360,"his own tribe when he returns home; and as, sooner or later, he is",Elementary Forms
41360,"forced to invite his former hosts, there is a continual exchange of",Elementary Forms
41360,ideas from tribe to tribe. It is thus that an international mythology,Elementary Forms
41360,"was established, of which the great god was quite naturally the",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential element, for it had its origin in the rites of initiation",Elementary Forms
41360,which it is his function to personify. So his name passed from one,Elementary Forms
41360,"language to another, along with the representations which were attached",Elementary Forms
41360,to it. The fact that the names of the phratries are generally the same,Elementary Forms
41360,in very different tribes could not fail to facilitate this diffusion.,Elementary Forms
41360,The internationalism of the totems opened the way for that of the great,Elementary Forms
41360,god.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,V,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We thus reach the highest conception to which totemism has arrived. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is the point where it touches and prepares the religions which are to,Elementary Forms
41360,"follow, and aids us in understanding them. But at the same time, we are",Elementary Forms
41360,able to see that this culminating idea is united without any,Elementary Forms
41360,interruption to the crudest beliefs which we analysed to start with.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, the great tribal god is only an ancestral spirit who finally",Elementary Forms
41360,won a pre-eminent place. The ancestral spirits are only entities forged,Elementary Forms
41360,in the image of the individual souls whose origin they are destined to,Elementary Forms
41360,"explain. The souls, in their turn, are only the form taken by the",Elementary Forms
41360,"impersonal forces which we found at the basis of totemism, as they",Elementary Forms
41360,individualize themselves in the human body. The unity of the system is,Elementary Forms
41360,as great as its complexity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In this work of elaboration, the idea of the soul has undoubtedly played",Elementary Forms
41360,an important part: it is through it that the idea of personality has,Elementary Forms
41360,"been introduced into the domain of religion. But it is not true that, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"the theorists of animism maintain, it contains the germ of the whole",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion. First of all, it presupposes the notion of _mana_ or the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic principle of which it is only a special form. Then, if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"spirits and gods could not be conceived before the soul, they are,",Elementary Forms
41360,"nevertheless, more than mere human souls, liberated by death; else",Elementary Forms
41360,whence would come their supernatural powers? The idea of the soul has,Elementary Forms
41360,merely served to direct the mythological imagination in a new way and to,Elementary Forms
41360,suggest to it constructions of a new sort. But the matter for these,Elementary Forms
41360,"conceptions has been taken, not from the representation of the soul, but",Elementary Forms
41360,from this reservoir of the anonymous and diffused forces which,Elementary Forms
41360,constitute the original foundation of religions. The creation of,Elementary Forms
41360,mythical personalities has only been another way of thinking of these,Elementary Forms
41360,essential forces.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As for the notion of the great god, it is due entirely to the sentiment",Elementary Forms
41360,whose action we have already observed in the genesis of the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"specifically totemic beliefs: this is the tribal sentiment. In fact, we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have seen that totemism was not the work of isolated clans, but that it",Elementary Forms
41360,was always elaborated in the body of a tribe which was to some degree,Elementary Forms
41360,conscious of its unity. It is for this reason that the different cults,Elementary Forms
41360,peculiar to each clan mutually touch and complete each other in such a,Elementary Forms
41360,way as to form a unified whole.[998] Now it is this same sentiment of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribal unity which is expressed in the conception of a supreme god,",Elementary Forms
41360,common to the tribe as a whole. So they are quite the same causes which,Elementary Forms
41360,are active at the bottom and at the top of this religious system.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, up to the present, we have considered the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,representations as if they were self-sufficient and could be explained,Elementary Forms
41360,"by themselves. But in reality, they are inseparable from the rites, not",Elementary Forms
41360,"only because they manifest themselves there, but also because they, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"their turn, feel the influence of these. Of course the cult depends upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"the beliefs, but it also reacts upon them. So in order to understand",Elementary Forms
41360,"them better, it is important to understand it better. The moment has",Elementary Forms

41360,We do not have the intention of attempting a complete description of the,Elementary Forms
41360,primitive cult in what is to follow. Being preoccupied especially with,Elementary Forms
41360,reaching that which is most elementary and most fundamental in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious life, we shall not attempt to reconstruct in detail the",Elementary Forms
41360,frequently confused multiplicity of all the ritual forms. But out of the,Elementary Forms
41360,midst of this extreme diversity of practices we should like to touch,Elementary Forms
41360,upon the most characteristic attitudes which the primitive observes in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the celebration of his cult, to classify the most general forms of his",Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, and to determine their origins and significance, in order that we",Elementary Forms
41360,"may control and, if there is occasion, make more definite the results to",Elementary Forms
41360,which the analysis of the beliefs has led us.[999],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Every cult presents a double aspect, one negative, the other positive.",Elementary Forms
41360,"In reality, of course, the two sorts of rites which we denominate thus",Elementary Forms
41360,are closely associated; we shall see that they suppose one another. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"still, they are different and, if it is only to understand their",Elementary Forms
41360,"connection, it is necessary to distinguish them.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By definition, sacred beings are separated beings. That which",Elementary Forms
41360,characterizes them is that there is a break of continuity between them,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the profane beings. Normally, the first are outside the others. A",Elementary Forms
41360,whole group of rites has the object of realizing this state of,Elementary Forms
41360,separation which is essential. Since their function is to prevent undue,Elementary Forms
41360,mixings and to keep one of these two domains from encroaching upon the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other, they are only able to impose abstentions or negative acts.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Therefore, we propose to give the name negative cult to the system",Elementary Forms
41360,formed by these special rites. They do not prescribe certain acts to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"faithful, but confine themselves to forbidding certain ways of acting;",Elementary Forms
41360,"so they all take the form of interdictions, or as is commonly said by",Elementary Forms
41360,"ethnographers, of _taboos_. This latter word is the one used in the",Elementary Forms
41360,Polynesian languages to designate the institution in virtue of which,Elementary Forms
41360,certain things are withdrawn from common use[1000]; it is also an,Elementary Forms
41360,adjective expressing the distinctive characteristic of these kinds of,Elementary Forms
41360,things. We have already had occasion to show how hard it is to translate,Elementary Forms
41360,a strictly local and dialectical expression like this into a generic,Elementary Forms
41360,term. There is no religion where there are no interdictions and where,Elementary Forms
41360,they do not play a considerable part; so it is regrettable that the,Elementary Forms
41360,consecrated terminology should seem to make so universal an institution,Elementary Forms
41360,into a peculiarity of Polynesia.[1001] The expression _interdicts_ or,Elementary Forms
41360,"_interdictions_ seems to us to be much more preferable. However, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"word taboo, like the word totem, is so customary that it would show an",Elementary Forms
41360,"excess of purism to prohibit it systematically; also, the inconveniences",Elementary Forms
41360,it may have are attenuated when its real meaning and importance have,Elementary Forms
41360,once been definitely stated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there are interdictions of different sorts which it is important to,Elementary Forms
41360,distinguish; for we shall not have to treat all kinds of interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,in this chapter.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"First of all, beside those coming from religion, there are others which",Elementary Forms
41360,"are due to magic. The two have this in common, that they declare certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"things incompatible, and prescribe the separation of the things whose",Elementary Forms
41360,incompatibility is thus proclaimed. But there are also very grave,Elementary Forms
41360,"differences between them. In the first place, the sanctions are not the",Elementary Forms
41360,same in the two cases. Of course the violation of the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"interdicts is frequently believed, as we shall presently see, to bring",Elementary Forms
41360,"about material disorders mechanically, from which the guilty man will",Elementary Forms
41360,"suffer, and which are regarded as a judgment on his act. But even if",Elementary Forms
41360,these really come about this spontaneous and automatic judgment is not,Elementary Forms
41360,"the only one; it is always completed by another one, supposing human",Elementary Forms
41360,"intervention. A real punishment is added to this, if it does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"anticipate it, and this one is deliberately inflicted by men; or at",Elementary Forms
41360,least there is a blame and public reprobation. Even when the sacrilege,Elementary Forms
41360,"has been punished, as it were, by the sickness or natural death of its",Elementary Forms
41360,"author, it is also defamed; it offends opinion, which reacts against it;",Elementary Forms
41360,"it puts the man who did it in fault. On the contrary, the magic",Elementary Forms
41360,interdiction is judged only by the material consequences which the,Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden act is believed to produce, with a sort of physical",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity. In disobeying, a man runs risks similar to those to which an",Elementary Forms
41360,invalid exposes himself in not following the advice of his physician;,Elementary Forms
41360,but in this case disobedience is not a fault; it creates no indignation.,Elementary Forms
41360,"There is no sin in magic. Moreover, this difference in sanction is due",Elementary Forms
41360,to a profound difference in the nature of the interdictions. The,Elementary Forms
41360,religious interdiction necessarily implies the notion of sacredness; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"comes from the respect inspired by the sacred object, and its purpose is",Elementary Forms
41360,"to keep this respect from failing. On the other hand, the interdictions",Elementary Forms
41360,of magic suppose only a wholly lay notion of property. The things which,Elementary Forms
41360,"the magician recommends to be kept separate are those which, by reason",Elementary Forms
41360,"of their characteristic properties, cannot be brought together and",Elementary Forms
41360,confused without danger. Even if he happens to ask his clients to keep,Elementary Forms
41360,"at a distance from certain sacred things, it is not through respect for",Elementary Forms
41360,"them and fear that they may be profaned, for, as we know, magic lives on",Elementary Forms
41360,profanations;[1002] it is merely for reasons of temporal utility. In a,Elementary Forms
41360,"word, religious interdictions are categorical imperatives; others are",Elementary Forms
41360,"useful maxims, the first form of hygienic and medical interdictions. We",Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot study two orders of facts as different as these simultaneously,",Elementary Forms
41360,"or even under the same name, without confusion. We are only concerned",Elementary Forms
41360,with the religious interdictions here.[1003],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But a new distinction is necessary between these latter.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There are religious interdictions whose object is to separate two sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"things of different species from each other. For example, it will be",Elementary Forms
41360,remembered that among the Wakelbura the scaffold upon which the corpse,Elementary Forms
41360,is exposed must be made exclusively of materials belonging to the,Elementary Forms
41360,phratry of the dead man; this is as much as to say that all contact,Elementary Forms
41360,"between the corpse, which is sacred, and the things of the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratry, which are also sacred, but differently, is forbidden.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Elsewhere, the arms which one uses to hunt an animal with cannot be made",Elementary Forms
41360,out of a kind of wood that is classed in the same social group as the,Elementary Forms
41360,animal itself.[1004] But the most important of these interdictions are,Elementary Forms
41360,the ones which we shall study in the next chapter; they are intended to,Elementary Forms
41360,prevent all communication between the purely sacred and the impurely,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred, between the sacredly auspicious and the sacredly inauspicious.",Elementary Forms
41360,"All these interdictions have one common characteristic; they come, not",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the fact that some things are sacred while others are not, but from",Elementary Forms
41360,the fact that there are inequalities and incompatibilities between,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred things. So they do not touch what is essential in the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,sacredness. The observance of these prohibitions can give place only to,Elementary Forms
41360,isolated rites which are particular and almost exceptional; but it could,Elementary Forms
41360,"not make a real cult, for before all, a cult is made by regular",Elementary Forms
41360,relations between the profane and the sacred as such.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there is another system of religious interdictions which is much,Elementary Forms
41360,"more extended and important; this is the one which separates, not",Elementary Forms
41360,"different species of sacred things, but all that is sacred from all that",Elementary Forms
41360,is profane. So it is derived immediately from the notion of sacredness,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, and it limits itself to expressing and realizing this. Thus it",Elementary Forms
41360,"furnishes the material for a veritable cult, and even of a cult which is",Elementary Forms
41360,at the basis of all the others; for the attitude which it prescribes is,Elementary Forms
41360,one from which the worshipper must never depart in all his relations,Elementary Forms
41360,with the sacred. It is what we call the negative cult. We may say that,Elementary Forms
41360,its interdicts are the religious interdicts _par excellence_.[1005] It,Elementary Forms
41360,is only these that we shall discuss in the following pages.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But they take multiple forms. Here are the principal ones which we,Elementary Forms
41360,observe in Australia.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Before all are the interdictions of contact; these are the original,Elementary Forms
41360,"taboos, of which the others are scarcely more than particular varieties.",Elementary Forms
41360,They rest upon the principle that the profane should never touch the,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred. We have seen already that the uninitiated may not touch the,Elementary Forms
41360,churinga or the bull-roarers under any circumstances. If adults are,Elementary Forms
41360,"allowed the free use of them, it is because initiation has conferred a",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character upon them. Blood, and especially that which flows",Elementary Forms
41360,"during the initiation, has a religious virtue;[1006] it is under the",Elementary Forms
41360,same interdict.[1007] It is the same with the hair.[1008] A dead man is,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred because the soul which animated the body stays with the corpse;,Elementary Forms
41360,for this reason it is sometimes forbidden to carry the bones of a dead,Elementary Forms
41360,man about unless they are wrapped up in a piece of bark.[1009] Even the,Elementary Forms
41360,"place where the death took place should be avoided, for they believe",Elementary Forms
41360,that the soul of the dead man continues to haunt the spot. That is why,Elementary Forms
41360,they break camp and move some distance away;[1010] in certain cases they,Elementary Forms
41360,"destroy it along with everything it contains,[1011] and a certain time",Elementary Forms
41360,must elapse before they can come back to the same place.[1012] Thus it,Elementary Forms
41360,comes about that a dying man creates an empty space about him; they,Elementary Forms
41360,abandon him after they have installed him as comfortably as,Elementary Forms
41360,possible.[1013],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,An exceptionally intimate contact is the one resulting from the,Elementary Forms
41360,absorption of food. Hence comes the interdiction against eating the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred animals or vegetables, and especially those serving as",Elementary Forms
41360,totems.[1014] Such an act appears so very sacrilegious that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"prohibition covers even adults, or at least, the majority of them; only",Elementary Forms
41360,the old men attain a sufficient religious dignity to escape this,Elementary Forms
41360,interdict sometimes. This prohibition has sometimes been explained by,Elementary Forms
41360,the mythical kinship uniting the man to the animals whose name he bears;,Elementary Forms
41360,they are protected by the sentiment of sympathy which they inspire by,Elementary Forms
41360,their position as kin.[1015] But the fact that the consumption of the,Elementary Forms
41360,forbidden flesh is believed to cause sickness or death automatically,Elementary Forms
41360,shows that this interdiction does not have its origin in the simple,Elementary Forms
41360,revolt of the feeling of domestic relationship. Forces of another sort,Elementary Forms
41360,are in action which are analogous to those in all religions and which,Elementary Forms
41360,are believed to react against sacrileges.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, if certain foods are forbidden to the profane because they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred, certain others, on the contrary, are forbidden to persons of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character, because they are profane. Thus it frequently happens",Elementary Forms
41360,that certain animals are specially designated as the food of women; for,Elementary Forms
41360,"this reason, they believe that they partake of a feminine nature and",Elementary Forms
41360,"that they are consequently profane. On the other hand, the young",Elementary Forms
41360,initiate is submitted to a series of rites of particular severity; to,Elementary Forms
41360,give him the virtues which will enable him to enter into the world of,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred things, from which he had up till then been excluded, they centre",Elementary Forms
41360,an exceptionally powerful group of religious forces upon him. Thus he,Elementary Forms
41360,enters into a state of sanctity which keeps all that is profane at a,Elementary Forms
41360,distance. Then he is not allowed to eat the game which is regarded as,Elementary Forms
41360,the special food of women.[1016],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But contact may be established by other means than the touch. One comes,Elementary Forms
41360,into relations with a thing by merely regarding it: a look is a means of,Elementary Forms
41360,contact. This is why the sight of sacred things is forbidden to the,Elementary Forms
41360,profane in certain cases. A woman should never see the instruments of,Elementary Forms
41360,the cult; the most that is permitted her is to catch a glimpse of them,Elementary Forms
41360,from afar.[1017] It is the same with the totemic paintings executed on,Elementary Forms
41360,the bodies of the officiants in the exceptionally important,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies.[1018] The exceptional solemnity of the rites of initiation,Elementary Forms
41360,prevents the women in certain tribes from seeing the place where they,Elementary Forms
41360,were celebrated[1019] or even the neophyte himself.[1020] The sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,character which is imminent in the ceremony as a whole is naturally,Elementary Forms
41360,found in the persons of those who directed it or took some part in,Elementary Forms
41360,it; the result of this is that the novice may not raise his eyes,Elementary Forms
41360,"to them, and this interdiction continues even after the rite is",Elementary Forms
41360,accomplished.[1021] A dead man is also removed from view sometimes: his,Elementary Forms
41360,face is covered over in such a way that it cannot be seen.[1022],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The word is another way of entering into relations with persons or,Elementary Forms
41360,things. The breath expired establishes a communication; this is a part,Elementary Forms
41360,of us which spreads outwards. Thus it is forbidden to the profane to,Elementary Forms
41360,address the sacred beings or simply to speak in their presence. Just as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the neophyte must not regard either the operators or the assistants, so",Elementary Forms
41360,it is forbidden to him to converse with them except by signs; and this,Elementary Forms
41360,"interdiction keeps the place to which it has been raised, by means of a",Elementary Forms
41360,special rite.[1023],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a general way, there are, among the Arunta, moments in the course of",Elementary Forms
41360,the great ceremonies when silence is obligatory.[1024] As soon as the,Elementary Forms
41360,"churinga are exposed, every one keeps still, or if someone talks, he",Elementary Forms
41360,does so in a low voice or with his lips only.[1025],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Besides the sacred things, there are words and sounds which have the",Elementary Forms
41360,same character; they should not pass the lips of the profane or enter,Elementary Forms
41360,their ears. There are ritual songs which women must not hear under pain,Elementary Forms
41360,"of death.[1026] They may hear the noise of the bull-roarers, but only",Elementary Forms
41360,from a distance. Every proper name is considered an essential element of,Elementary Forms
41360,the person who bears it; being closely associated in the mind to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"idea of this person, it participates in the sentiments which this latter",Elementary Forms
41360,"inspires. So if the one is sacred, the other is. Therefore, it may not",Elementary Forms
41360,be pronounced in the course of the profane life. Among the Warramunga,Elementary Forms
41360,"there is one totem which is particularly venerated, this is the snake",Elementary Forms
41360,"called Wollunqua; its name is taboo.[1027] It is the same with Baiame,",Elementary Forms
41360,Daramulun and Bunjil; the esoteric form of their name must not be,Elementary Forms
41360,"revealed to the uninitiate.[1028] During mourning, the name of the dead",Elementary Forms
41360,"man must not be mentioned, at least by his parents, except when there is",Elementary Forms
41360,"an absolute necessity, and even in this case it must be whispered.[1029]",Elementary Forms
41360,This interdiction is frequently perpetual for the widow and certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"relatives.[1030] Among certain peoples, this even extends beyond the",Elementary Forms
41360,family; all the individuals whose name is the same as that of the dead,Elementary Forms
41360,man must change theirs temporarily.[1031] But there is more than this:,Elementary Forms
41360,the relatives and intimate friends sometimes abstain from certain words,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the usual language, undoubtedly because they were employed by the",Elementary Forms
41360,dead man; these gaps are filled in by means of periphrases or words,Elementary Forms
41360,taken from some foreign dialects.[1032] In addition to their public and,Elementary Forms
41360,everyday names all men have another which is kept a secret: the women,Elementary Forms
41360,and children do not know it; it is never used in the ordinary life. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is because it has a religious character.[1033] There are even ceremonies,Elementary Forms
41360,during which it is necessary to speak a special language which must not,Elementary Forms
41360,be used for profane purposes. It is the beginning of a sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,language.[1034],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Not only are the sacred beings separated from the profane, but also",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing which either directly or indirectly concerns the profane life,Elementary Forms
41360,should be confused with the religious life. Complete nudity is,Elementary Forms
41360,frequently demanded of the native as a prerequisite to being admitted to,Elementary Forms
41360,participation in the rites;[1035] he is required to strip himself of all,Elementary Forms
41360,"his habitual ornaments, even those to which he is the most attached, and",Elementary Forms
41360,from which he separates himself the least willingly because of the,Elementary Forms
41360,protecting virtues he attributes to them.[1036] If he is obliged to,Elementary Forms
41360,"decorate himself to play his part in the ritual, this decoration has to",Elementary Forms
41360,"be made specially for the occasion; it is a ceremonial costume, a gala",Elementary Forms
41360,"dress.[1037] As these ornaments are sacred, owing to the use made of",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, he is forbidden to use them in profane affairs; when the ceremony",Elementary Forms
41360,"is finished, they are buried or burnt;[1038] the men must even wash",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves in such a way as to carry away with them no trace of the,Elementary Forms
41360,decorations with which they were adorned.[1039],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In general, all acts characteristic of the ordinary life are forbidden",Elementary Forms
41360,while those of the religious life are taking place. The act of eating,Elementary Forms
41360,"is, of itself, profane; for it takes place every day, it satisfies",Elementary Forms
41360,essentially utilitarian and material needs and it is a part of our,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinary existence.[1040] This is why it is prohibited in religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"times. When one totemic group has loaned its churinga to a foreign clan,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is an exceptionally solemn moment when they are brought back and put,Elementary Forms
41360,into the ertnatulunga; all those who take part in the ceremony must fast,Elementary Forms
41360,"as long as it lasts, and it lasts a long time.[1041] The same rule is",Elementary Forms
41360,"observed during the rites,[1042] of which we shall speak in the next",Elementary Forms
41360,"chapter, as well as at certain moments of the initiation.[1043]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"For this same reason, all temporal occupations are suspended while the",Elementary Forms
41360,great religious solemnities are taking place. According to a remark of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen,[1044] which we have already had occasion to cite,",Elementary Forms
41360,the life of the Australian is divided into two very distinct parts: the,Elementary Forms
41360,"one is devoted to hunting, fishing and warfare; the other is consecrated",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the cult, and these two forms of activity mutually exclude and repel",Elementary Forms
41360,one another. It is on this principle that the universal institution of,Elementary Forms
41360,religious days of rest reposes. The distinctive character of the,Elementary Forms
41360,feast-days in all known religions is the cessation of work and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"suspension of public and private life, in so far as it does not have a",Elementary Forms
41360,religious objective. This repose is not merely a sort of temporary,Elementary Forms
41360,relaxation which men have given themselves in order to give themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,up more freely to the sentiments of joy ordinarily awakened by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"feast-days; for they are sad feasts, consecrated to mourning and",Elementary Forms
41360,"repentance, and during which this cessation is no less obligatory. This",Elementary Forms
41360,is because work is an eminent form of profane activity: it has no other,Elementary Forms
41360,apparent end than to provide for the temporal necessities of life; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"puts us in relations with ordinary things only. On feast days, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, the religious life attains an exceptional degree of intensity.",Elementary Forms
41360,So the contrast between the two forms of existence is especially marked,Elementary Forms
41360,"at this moment; consequently, they cannot remain near to each other. A",Elementary Forms
41360,man cannot approach his god intimately while he still bears on him marks,Elementary Forms
41360,"of his profane life; inversely, he cannot return to his usual",Elementary Forms
41360,occupations when a rite has just sanctified him. So the ritual day of,Elementary Forms
41360,rest is only one particular case of the general incompatibility,Elementary Forms
41360,separating the sacred from the profane; it is the result of an,Elementary Forms
41360,interdiction.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It would be impossible to enumerate here all the different interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,"which have been observed, even in the Australian religions alone. Like",Elementary Forms
41360,"the notion of sacredness upon which it rests, the system of interdicts",Elementary Forms
41360,extends into the most diverse relations; it is even used deliberately,Elementary Forms
41360,"for utilitarian ends.[1045] But howsoever complex it may be, it finally",Elementary Forms
41360,"rests upon two fundamental interdictions, which summarize it and",Elementary Forms
41360,dominate it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, the religious life and the profane life cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,"coexist in the same place. If the former is to develop, a special spot",Elementary Forms
41360,"must be placed at its disposition, from which the second is excluded.",Elementary Forms
41360,Hence comes the founding of temples and sanctuaries: these are the spots,Elementary Forms
41360,"awarded to sacred beings and things and serve them as residences, for",Elementary Forms
41360,they cannot establish themselves in any place except on the condition of,Elementary Forms
41360,entirely appropriating to themselves all within a certain distance. Such,Elementary Forms
41360,arrangements are so indispensable to all religious life that even the,Elementary Forms
41360,"most inferior religions cannot do without them. The ertnatulunga, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"spot where the churinga are deposited, is a veritable sanctuary. So the",Elementary Forms
41360,uninitiated are not allowed to approach it. It is even forbidden to,Elementary Forms
41360,carry on any profane occupation whatsoever there. As we shall presently,Elementary Forms
41360,"see, there are other holy places where important ceremonies are",Elementary Forms
41360,celebrated.[1046],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Likewise, the religious life and the profane life cannot coexist in the",Elementary Forms
41360,same unit of time. It is necessary to assign determined days or periods,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the first, from which all profane occupations are excluded. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"feast days are born. There is no religion, and, consequently, no society",Elementary Forms
41360,which has not known and practised this division of time into two,Elementary Forms
41360,"distinct parts, alternating with one another according to a law varying",Elementary Forms
41360,"with the peoples and the civilizations; as we have already pointed out,",Elementary Forms
41360,it was probably the necessity of this alternation which led men to,Elementary Forms
41360,"introduce into the continuity and homogeneity of duration, certain",Elementary Forms
41360,distinctions and differentiations which it does not naturally,Elementary Forms
41360,"have.[1047] Of course, it is almost impossible that the religious life",Elementary Forms
41360,should ever succeed in concentrating itself hermetically in the places,Elementary Forms
41360,and times which are thus attributed to it; it is inevitable that a,Elementary Forms
41360,little of it should filter out. There are always some sacred things,Elementary Forms
41360,outside the sanctuaries; there are some rites that can be celebrated on,Elementary Forms
41360,work-days. But these are sacred things of the second rank and rites of a,Elementary Forms
41360,lesser importance. Concentration remains the dominating characteristic,Elementary Forms
41360,of this organization. Generally this concentration is complete for all,Elementary Forms
41360,"that concerns the public cult, which cannot be celebrated except in",Elementary Forms
41360,"common. The individual, private cult is the only one which comes very",Elementary Forms
41360,near to the temporal life. Thus the contrast between these two,Elementary Forms
41360,successive phases of human life attains its maximum of intensity in the,Elementary Forms
41360,inferior societies; for it is there that the individual cult is the most,Elementary Forms
41360,rudimentary.[1048],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Up to the present, the negative cult has been presented to us only as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"system of abstentions. So it seems to serve only to inhibit activity,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and not to stimulate it or to modify it. And yet, as an unexpected",Elementary Forms
41360,"reaction to this inhibitive effect, it is found to exercise a positive",Elementary Forms
41360,action of the highest importance over the religious and moral nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,the individual.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, owing to the barrier which separates the sacred from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"profane, a man cannot enter into intimate relations with sacred things",Elementary Forms
41360,except after ridding himself of all that is profane in him. He cannot,Elementary Forms
41360,lead a religious life of even a slight intensity unless he commences by,Elementary Forms
41360,withdrawing more or less completely from the temporal life. So the,Elementary Forms
41360,negative cult is in one sense a means in view of an end: it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,condition of access to the positive cult. It does not confine itself to,Elementary Forms
41360,protecting sacred beings from vulgar contact; it acts upon the,Elementary Forms
41360,worshipper himself and modifies his condition positively. The man who,Elementary Forms
41360,has submitted himself to its prescribed interdictions is not the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"afterwards as he was before. Before, he was an ordinary being who, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"this reason, had to keep at a distance from the religious forces.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Afterwards, he is on a more equal footing with them; he has approached",Elementary Forms
41360,the sacred by the very act of leaving the profane; he has purified and,Elementary Forms
41360,sanctified himself by the very act of detaching himself from the base,Elementary Forms
41360,and trivial matters that debased his nature. So the negative rites,Elementary Forms
41360,"confer efficient powers just as well as the positive ones; the first,",Elementary Forms
41360,"like the second, can serve to elevate the religious tone of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual. According to a very true remark which has been made, no one",Elementary Forms
41360,can engage in a religious ceremony of any importance without first,Elementary Forms
41360,submitting himself to a sort of preliminary initiation which introduces,Elementary Forms
41360,"him progressively into the sacred world.[1049] Unctions, lustrations,",Elementary Forms
41360,benedictions or any essentially positive operation may be used for this,Elementary Forms
41360,purpose; but the same result may be attained by means of fasts and,Elementary Forms
41360,"vigils or retreat and silence, that is to say, by ritual abstinences,",Elementary Forms
41360,which are nothing more than certain interdictions put into practice.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When there are only particular and isolated negative rites, their",Elementary Forms
41360,positive action is generally too slight to be easily perceptible. But,Elementary Forms
41360,there are circumstances when a whole system of interdictions is,Elementary Forms
41360,"concentrated on one man; in these cases, their effects accumulate, and",Elementary Forms
41360,thus become more manifest. This takes place in Australia at the time of,Elementary Forms
41360,the initiation. The neophyte is submitted to a great variety of,Elementary Forms
41360,negative rites. He must withdraw from the society in which his existence,Elementary Forms
41360,"has been passed up till then, and from almost all human society. Not",Elementary Forms
41360,"only is it forbidden for him to see women and uninitiated persons,[1050]",Elementary Forms
41360,"but he also goes to live in the brush, far from his fellows, under the",Elementary Forms
41360,direction of some old men who serve him as godfathers.[1051] So very,Elementary Forms
41360,"true is it that the forest is considered his natural environment, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a certain number of tribes, the word with which the initiation is",Elementary Forms
41360,designated signifies _that which is from the forest_.[1052] For this,Elementary Forms
41360,"same reason, he is frequently decorated with leaves during the",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies at which he assists.[1053] In this way he passes long,Elementary Forms
41360,"months,[1054] interspersed from time to time with rites in which he must",Elementary Forms
41360,take a part. This time is a period of all sorts of abstinences for him.,Elementary Forms
41360,A multitude of foods are forbidden him; he is allowed only that quantity,Elementary Forms
41360,of food which is absolutely indispensable for the maintenance of,Elementary Forms
41360,"life;[1055] he is even sometimes bound to a rigorous fast,[1056] or must",Elementary Forms
41360,"eat impure foods.[1057] When he eats, he must not touch the food with",Elementary Forms
41360,his hands; his godfathers put it into his mouth for him.[1058] In some,Elementary Forms
41360,"cases, he must go to beg his food.[1059] Likewise, he sleeps only as",Elementary Forms
41360,"much as is indispensable.[1060] He must abstain from talking, to the",Elementary Forms
41360,extent of not uttering a word; it is by signs that he makes known his,Elementary Forms
41360,needs.[1061] He must not wash;[1062] sometimes he must not move. He,Elementary Forms
41360,"remains stretched out upon the earth, immobile[1063] and without",Elementary Forms
41360,clothing of any sort.[1064] Now the result of the numerous interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,is to bring about a radical change of condition in the initiate. Before,Elementary Forms
41360,"the initiation, he lived with the women; he was excluded from the cult.",Elementary Forms
41360,"After it, he is admitted to the society of men; he takes part in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, and has acquired a sacred character. The metamorphosis is so",Elementary Forms
41360,complete that it is sometimes represented as a second birth. They,Elementary Forms
41360,"imagine that the profane person, who was the young man up till then, has",Elementary Forms
41360,"died, that he has been killed and carried away by the god of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"initiation, Bunjil, Baiame or Daramulun, and that quite another",Elementary Forms
41360,individual has taken the place of the one that no longer is.[1065] So,Elementary Forms
41360,here we find the very heart of the positive effects of which negative,Elementary Forms
41360,rites are capable. Of course we do not mean to say that these latter,Elementary Forms
41360,produced this great transformation all by themselves; but they certainly,Elementary Forms
41360,"contributed to it, and largely.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the light of these facts, we are able to understand what asceticism",Elementary Forms
41360,"is, what place it occupies in the religious life and whence come the",Elementary Forms
41360,"virtues which have generally been attributed to it. In fact, there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,"interdict, the observance of which does not have an ascetic character to",Elementary Forms
41360,a certain degree. Abstaining from something which may be useful or from,Elementary Forms
41360,"a form of activity which, since it is usual, should answer to some human",Elementary Forms
41360,"need, is, of necessity, imposing constraints and renunciations. So in",Elementary Forms
41360,"order to have real asceticism, it is sufficient for these practices to",Elementary Forms
41360,develop in such a way as to become the basis of a veritable scheme of,Elementary Forms
41360,"life. Normally, the negative cult serves only as an introduction and",Elementary Forms
41360,preparation for the positive cult. But it sometimes happens that it,Elementary Forms
41360,"frees itself from this subordination and passes to the first place, and",Elementary Forms
41360,that the system of interdicts swells and exaggerates itself to the point,Elementary Forms
41360,of usurping the entire existence. Thus a systematic asceticism is born,Elementary Forms
41360,which is consequently nothing more than a hypertrophy of the negative,Elementary Forms
41360,cult. The special virtues which it is believed to confer are only an,Elementary Forms
41360,"amplified form of those conferred, to a lesser degree, by the practice",Elementary Forms
41360,of any interdiction. They have the same origin; for they both rest on,Elementary Forms
41360,the principle that a man sanctifies himself only by efforts made to,Elementary Forms
41360,separate himself from the profane. The pure ascetic is a man who raises,Elementary Forms
41360,"himself above men and acquires a special sanctity by fasts and vigils,",Elementary Forms
41360,"by retreat and silence, or in a word, by privations, rather than by acts",Elementary Forms
41360,"of positive piety (offerings, sacrifices, prayers, etc.). History shows",Elementary Forms
41360,to what a high religious prestige one may attain by this method: the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Buddhist saint is essentially an ascetic, and he is equal or superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,the gods.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It follows that asceticism is not a rare, exceptional and nearly",Elementary Forms
41360,"abnormal fruit of the religious life, as some have supposed it to be; on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the contrary, it is one of its essential elements. Every religion",Elementary Forms
41360,"contains it, at least in germ, for there are none in which a system of",Elementary Forms
41360,interdicts is not found. Their only difference in this regard which,Elementary Forms
41360,there may be between cults is that this germ is more or less developed,Elementary Forms
41360,in different ones. It should also be added that there probably is not a,Elementary Forms
41360,"single one in which this development does not take, at least",Elementary Forms
41360,"temporarily, the characteristic traits of real asceticism. This is what",Elementary Forms
41360,"generally takes place at certain critical periods when, for a relatively",Elementary Forms
41360,"short time, it is necessary to bring about a grave change of condition",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a subject. Then, in order to introduce him more rapidly into the",Elementary Forms
41360,"circle of sacred things with which he must be put in contact, he is",Elementary Forms
41360,separated violently from the profane world; but this does not come,Elementary Forms
41360,without many abstinences and an exceptional recrudescence of the system,Elementary Forms
41360,of interdicts. Now this is just what happens in Australia at the moment,Elementary Forms
41360,"of initiation. In order to transform youths into men, it is necessary to",Elementary Forms
41360,make them live the life of a veritable ascetic. Mrs. Parker very justly,Elementary Forms
41360,calls them the monks of Baiame.[1066],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But abstinences and privations do not come without suffering. We hold to,Elementary Forms
41360,the profane world by all the fibres of our flesh; our senses attach us,Elementary Forms
41360,to it; our life depends upon it. It is not merely the natural theatre of,Elementary Forms
41360,our activity; it penetrates us from every side; it is a part of,Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves. So we cannot detach ourselves from it without doing violence,Elementary Forms
41360,to our nature and without painfully wounding our instincts. In other,Elementary Forms
41360,"words, the negative cult cannot develop without causing suffering. Pain",Elementary Forms
41360,is one of its necessary conditions. Some have been led to think of it as,Elementary Forms
41360,constituting a sort of rite in itself; they have seen in it a state of,Elementary Forms
41360,"grace which is to be sought and aroused, even artificially, because of",Elementary Forms
41360,the powers and privileges which it confers in the same way as these,Elementary Forms
41360,"systems of interdicts, of which it is the natural accompaniment. So far",Elementary Forms
41360,"as we know, Preuss is the first who has realized the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,role[1067] which is attributed to suffering in the inferior societies.,Elementary Forms
41360,He cites the case of the Arapahs who inflict veritable torments upon,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves in order to become immune from the dangers of battle; of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Big Belly Indians who submit to actual tortures on the eve of military,Elementary Forms
41360,expeditions; of the Hupa who swim in icy rivers and then remain,Elementary Forms
41360,"stretched out on the bank as long as possible, in order to assure",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves of success in their enterprises; of the Karaya who from time,Elementary Forms
41360,to time draw blood from their arms and legs by means of scratches made,Elementary Forms
41360,"out of the teeth of fish, in order to strengthen their muscles; of the",Elementary Forms
41360,men of Dallmannhafen (Emperor William's Land in New Guinea) who combat,Elementary Forms
41360,the sterility of their women by making bloody incisions in the upper,Elementary Forms
41360,part of their thighs.[1068],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But similar facts may be found without leaving Australia, especially in",Elementary Forms
41360,the course of the initiation ceremonies. Many of the rites practised on,Elementary Forms
41360,this occasion consist in systematically inflicting certain pains on the,Elementary Forms
41360,neophyte in order to modify his condition and to make him acquire the,Elementary Forms
41360,"qualities characteristic of a man. Thus, among the Larakia, while the",Elementary Forms
41360,"young men are in retreat in the forest, their godfathers and guardians",Elementary Forms
41360,"give them violent blows at any instant, without warning and without",Elementary Forms
41360,"cause.[1069] Among the Urabunna, at a certain time, the novice is",Elementary Forms
41360,"stretched out on the ground, his face against the earth. All the men",Elementary Forms
41360,present beat him rudely; then they make four or eight gashes on his,Elementary Forms
41360,"back, arranged on each side of the dorsal spine and one on the meridial",Elementary Forms
41360,"line of the nape of his neck.[1070] Among the Arunta, the first rite of",Elementary Forms
41360,the initiation consists in tossing the subject in a blanket; the men,Elementary Forms
41360,"throw him into the air and catch him when he comes down, to throw him up",Elementary Forms
41360,"again.[1071] In the same tribe, at the close of this long series of",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies, the young man lies down on a bed of leaves under which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"have placed live coals; he remains there, immobile in the midst of the",Elementary Forms
41360,heat and suffocating smoke.[1072] A similar rite is observed among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Urabunna; but in addition, while the patient is in this painful",Elementary Forms
41360,"situation, they beat him on the back.[1073] In a general way, all the",Elementary Forms
41360,exercises to which he is submitted have this same character to such an,Elementary Forms
41360,"extent that when he is allowed to re-enter the ordinary life, he has a",Elementary Forms
41360,pitiful aspect and appears half stupefied.[1074] It is true that all,Elementary Forms
41360,these practices are frequently represented as ordeals destined to prove,Elementary Forms
41360,the value of the neophyte and to show whether he is worthy of being,Elementary Forms
41360,"admitted into the religious society or not.[1075] But in reality, the",Elementary Forms
41360,probational function of the rite is only another aspect of its efficacy.,Elementary Forms
41360,For the fact that it has been undergone is proved by its producing its,Elementary Forms
41360,"effect, that is to say, by its conferring the qualities which are the",Elementary Forms
41360,original reason for its existence.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In other cases, these ritual cruelties are executed, not on the organism",Elementary Forms
41360,"as a whole, but on a particular organ or tissue, whose vitality it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"their object to stimulate. Thus, among the Arunta, the Warramunga and",Elementary Forms
41360,"many other tribes,[1076] at a certain moment in the initiation, certain",Elementary Forms
41360,persons are charged with biting the novice severely in the scalp. This,Elementary Forms
41360,operation is so painful that the patient can hardly support it without,Elementary Forms
41360,uttering cries. Its object is to make the hair grow.[1077] The same,Elementary Forms
41360,treatment is applied to make the beard grow. The rite of pulling out,Elementary Forms
41360,"hairs, which Howitt mentions in other tribes, seems to have the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"reason for existence.[1078] According to Eylmann, the men and women of",Elementary Forms
41360,the Arunta and the Kaitish make small wounds on their arms with sticks,Elementary Forms
41360,"red with fire, in order to become skilful in making fire or to acquire",Elementary Forms
41360,the strength necessary for carrying heavy loads of wood.[1079] According,Elementary Forms
41360,"to this same observer, the Warramunga girls amputate the second and",Elementary Forms
41360,"third joints of the index finger on one hand, thinking that the finger",Elementary Forms
41360,thus becomes better fitted for finding yams.[1080],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is not impossible that the extraction of teeth was sometimes destined,Elementary Forms
41360,"to produce effects of this sort. In any case, it is certain that the",Elementary Forms
41360,cruel rites of circumcision and subincision have the object of,Elementary Forms
41360,"conferring particular powers on the genital organs. In fact, the young",Elementary Forms
41360,man is not allowed to marry until after he has undergone them; so he,Elementary Forms
41360,owes them special virtues. What makes this initiation _sui generis_,Elementary Forms
41360,"indispensable is that in all inferior societies, the union of the sexes",Elementary Forms
41360,is marked with a religious character. It is believed to put redoubtable,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces into play which a man cannot approach without danger, until after",Elementary Forms
41360,"he has acquired the necessary immunity, by ritual processes:[1081] for",Elementary Forms
41360,"this, a whole series of positive and negative practices is used, of",Elementary Forms
41360,which circumcision and subincision are the forerunners. By painfully,Elementary Forms
41360,"mutilating an organ, a sacred character is given to it, since by that",Elementary Forms
41360,"act, it is put into shape for resisting the equally sacred forces which",Elementary Forms
41360,it could not meet otherwise.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"At the beginning of this work, we said that all the essential elements",Elementary Forms
41360,"of religious thought and life ought to be found, at least in germ, in",Elementary Forms
41360,the most primitive religions: the preceding facts confirm this,Elementary Forms
41360,assertion. If there is any one belief which is believed to be peculiar,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the most recent and idealistic religions, it is the one attributing a",Elementary Forms
41360,sanctifying power to sorrow. Now this same belief is at the basis of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites which have just been observed. Of course, it is understood",Elementary Forms
41360,differently at the different moments of history when it is studied. For,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Christian, it acts especially upon the soul: it purges it, ennobles",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, spiritualizes it. For the Australian, it is the body over which it",Elementary Forms
41360,is efficient: it increases its vital energies; it makes its beard and,Elementary Forms
41360,hair grow; it toughens its members. But in both cases the principle is,Elementary Forms
41360,the same. In both it is admitted that suffering creates exceptional,Elementary Forms
41360,"strength. And this belief is not without foundation. In fact, it is by",Elementary Forms
41360,the way in which he braves suffering that the greatness of a man is best,Elementary Forms
41360,manifested. He never rises above himself with more brilliancy than when,Elementary Forms
41360,he subdues his own nature to the point of making it follow a way,Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary to the one it would spontaneously take. By this, he",Elementary Forms
41360,distinguishes himself from all the other creatures who follow blindly,Elementary Forms
41360,"wherever pleasure calls them; by this, he makes a place apart for",Elementary Forms
41360,himself in the world. Suffering is the sign that certain of the bonds,Elementary Forms
41360,attaching him to his profane environment are broken; so it testifies,Elementary Forms
41360,"that he is partially freed from this environment, and, consequently, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is justly considered the instrument of deliverance. So he who is thus,Elementary Forms
41360,delivered is not the victim of a pure illusion when he believes himself,Elementary Forms
41360,invested with a sort of mastery over things: he really has raised,Elementary Forms
41360,"himself above them, by the very act of renouncing them; he is stronger",Elementary Forms
41360,"than nature, because he makes it subside.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, it is by no means true that this virtue has only an aesthetic",Elementary Forms
41360,value: the whole religious life supposes it. Sacrifices and privations,Elementary Forms
41360,do not come without privations which cost the worshipper dear. Even if,Elementary Forms
41360,"the rites do not demand material gifts from him, they require his time",Elementary Forms
41360,"and his strength. In order to serve his gods, he must forget himself; to",Elementary Forms
41360,"make for them a fitting place in his own life, he must sacrifice his",Elementary Forms
41360,profane interests. The positive cult is possible only when a man is,Elementary Forms
41360,"trained to renouncement, to abnegation, to detachment from self, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently to suffering. It is necessary that he have no dread of,Elementary Forms
41360,them: he cannot even fulfil his duties joyfully unless he loves them to,Elementary Forms
41360,"some extent. But for that, it is necessary that he train himself, and it",Elementary Forms
41360,is to this that the ascetic practices tend. So the suffering which they,Elementary Forms
41360,"impose is not arbitrary and sterile cruelty; it is a necessary school,",Elementary Forms
41360,"where men form and temper themselves, and acquire the qualities of",Elementary Forms
41360,disinterestedness and endurance without which there would be no,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion. If this result is to be obtained, it is even a good thing that",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ascetic ideal be incarnated eminently in certain persons, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"speciality, so to speak, it is to represent, almost with excess, this",Elementary Forms
41360,"aspect of the ritual life; for they are like so many living models,",Elementary Forms
41360,inciting to effort. Such is the historic role of the great ascetics.,Elementary Forms
41360,"When their deeds and acts are analysed in detail, one asks himself what",Elementary Forms
41360,useful end they can have. He is struck by the fact that there is,Elementary Forms
41360,something excessive in the disdain they profess for all that ordinarily,Elementary Forms
41360,impassions men. But these exaggerations are necessary to sustain among,Elementary Forms
41360,the believers a sufficient disgust for an easy life and common,Elementary Forms
41360,"pleasures. It is necessary that an elite put the end too high, if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"crowd is not to put it too low. It is necessary that some exaggerate, if",Elementary Forms
41360,the average is to remain at a fitting level.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But asceticism does not serve religious ends only. Here, as elsewhere,",Elementary Forms
41360,religious interests are only the symbolic form of social and moral,Elementary Forms
41360,interests. The ideal beings to whom the cults are addressed are not the,Elementary Forms
41360,only ones who demand of their followers a certain disdain for suffering:,Elementary Forms
41360,society itself is possible only at this price. Though exalting the,Elementary Forms
41360,"strength of man, it is frequently rude to individuals; it necessarily",Elementary Forms
41360,demands perpetual sacrifices from them; it is constantly doing violence,Elementary Forms
41360,"to our natural appetites, just because it raises us above ourselves. If",Elementary Forms
41360,"we are going to fulfil our duties towards it, then we must be prepared",Elementary Forms
41360,to do violence to our instincts sometimes and to ascend the decline of,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature when it is necessary. So there is an asceticism which, being",Elementary Forms
41360,"inherent in all social life, is destined to survive all the mythologies",Elementary Forms
41360,and all the dogmas; it is an integral part of all human culture. At,Elementary Forms
41360,"bottom, this is the asceticism which is the reason for the existence of",Elementary Forms
41360,and the justification of that which has been taught by the religions of,Elementary Forms
41360,all times.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Having determined what the system of interdicts consists in and what its,Elementary Forms
41360,"positive and negative functions are, we must now seek the causes which",Elementary Forms
41360,have given it birth.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In one sense, it is logically implied in the very notion of sacredness.",Elementary Forms
41360,"All that is sacred is the object of respect, and every sentiment of",Elementary Forms
41360,"respect is translated, in him who feels it, by movements of inhibition.",Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, a respected being is always expressed in the consciousness by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"representation which, owing to the emotion it inspires, is charged with",Elementary Forms
41360,"a high mental energy; consequently, it is armed in such a way as to",Elementary Forms
41360,reject to a distance every other representation which denies it in whole,Elementary Forms
41360,or in part. Now the sacred world and the profane world are antagonistic,Elementary Forms
41360,to each other. They correspond to two forms of life which mutually,Elementary Forms
41360,"exclude one another, or which at least cannot be lived at the same time",Elementary Forms
41360,with the same intensity. We cannot give ourselves up entirely to the,Elementary Forms
41360,ideal beings to whom the cult is addressed and also to ourselves and our,Elementary Forms
41360,own interests at the same time; we cannot devote ourselves entirely to,Elementary Forms
41360,the group and entirely to our own egoism at once. Here there are two,Elementary Forms
41360,systems of conscious states which are directed and which direct our,Elementary Forms
41360,conduct towards opposite poles. So the one having the greater power of,Elementary Forms
41360,action should tend to exclude the other from the consciousness. When we,Elementary Forms
41360,"think of holy things, the idea of a profane object cannot enter the mind",Elementary Forms
41360,without encountering grave resistance; something within us opposes,Elementary Forms
41360,itself to its installation. This is because the representation of a,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred thing does not tolerate neighbours. But this psychic antagonism,Elementary Forms
41360,and this mutual exclusion of ideas should naturally result in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"exclusion of the corresponding things. If the ideas are not to coexist,",Elementary Forms
41360,the things must not touch each other or have any sort of relations. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is the very principle of the interdict.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the world of sacred things is, by definition, a world apart.",Elementary Forms
41360,Since it is opposed to the profane world by all the characteristics we,Elementary Forms
41360,"have mentioned, it must be treated in its own peculiar way: it would be",Elementary Forms
41360,a misunderstanding of its nature and a confusion of it with something,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is not, to make use of the gestures, language and attitudes",Elementary Forms
41360,"which we employ in our relations with ordinary things, when we have to",Elementary Forms
41360,do with the things that compose it. We may handle the former freely; we,Elementary Forms
41360,"speak freely to vulgar beings; so we do not touch the sacred beings, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"we touch them only with reserve; we do not speak in their presence, or",Elementary Forms
41360,we do not speak the common language there. All that is used in our,Elementary Forms
41360,commerce with the one must be excluded from our commerce with the other.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if this explanation is not inexact, it is, nevertheless,",Elementary Forms
41360,"insufficient. In fact, there are many beings which are the objects of",Elementary Forms
41360,respect without being protected by systems of rigorous interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,such as those we have just described. Of course there is a general,Elementary Forms
41360,"tendency of the mind to localize different things in different places,",Elementary Forms
41360,especially when they are incompatible with each other. But the profane,Elementary Forms
41360,"environment and the sacred one are not merely distinct, but they are",Elementary Forms
41360,also closed to one another; between them there is an abyss. So there,Elementary Forms
41360,"ought to be some particular reason in the nature of sacred things, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"causes this exceptional isolation and mutual exclusion. And, in fact, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"a sort of contradiction, the sacred world is inclined, as it were, to",Elementary Forms
41360,spread itself into this same profane world which it excludes elsewhere:,Elementary Forms
41360,"at the same time that it repels it, it tends to flow into it as soon as",Elementary Forms
41360,it approaches. This is why it is necessary to keep them at a distance,Elementary Forms
41360,from one another and to create a sort of vacuum between them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,What makes these precautions necessary is the extraordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,contagiousness of a sacred character. Far from being attached to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"things which are marked with it, it is endowed with a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,elusiveness. Even the most superficial or roundabout contact is,Elementary Forms
41360,sufficient to enable it to spread from one object to another. Religious,Elementary Forms
41360,forces are represented in the mind in such a way that they always seem,Elementary Forms
41360,ready to escape from the points where they reside and to enter,Elementary Forms
41360,everything passing within their range. The nanja tree where the spirit,Elementary Forms
41360,of an ancestor lives is sacred for the individual who considers himself,Elementary Forms
41360,the reincarnation of this ancestor. But every bird which alights upon,Elementary Forms
41360,this tree participates in this same nature: it is also forbidden to,Elementary Forms
41360,touch it.[1082] We have already had occasion to show how simple contact,Elementary Forms
41360,with a churinga is enough to sanctify men and things;[1083] it is also,Elementary Forms
41360,upon this principle of the contagiousness of sacredness that all the,Elementary Forms
41360,rites of consecration repose. The sanctity of the churinga is so great,Elementary Forms
41360,that its action is even felt at a distance. It will be remembered how,Elementary Forms
41360,"this extends not only to the cave where they are kept, but also to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"whole surrounding district, to the animals who take refuge there, whom",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is forbidden to kill, and to the plants which grow there, which must",Elementary Forms
41360,not be touched.[1084] A snake totem has its centre at a place where,Elementary Forms
41360,there is a water-hole. The sacred character of the totem is,Elementary Forms
41360,"communicated to this place, to the water-hole and even to the water",Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, which is forbidden to all the members of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,group.[1085] The initiate lives in an atmosphere charged with,Elementary Forms
41360,"religiousness, and it is as though he were impregnated with it",Elementary Forms
41360,himself.[1086] Consequently all that he possesses and all that he,Elementary Forms
41360,"touches is forbidden to the women, and withdrawn from their contact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"even down to the bird he has struck with his stick, the kangaroo he has",Elementary Forms
41360,"pierced with his lance or the fish which has bit on his hook.[1087] But,",Elementary Forms
41360,"on the other hand, the rites to which he is submitted and the things",Elementary Forms
41360,which have a part in them have a sanctity superior to his own: this,Elementary Forms
41360,sanctity is contagiously transmitted to everything which evokes the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,of one or the other. The tooth which has been knocked out of him is,Elementary Forms
41360,"considered very holy.[1088] For this reason, he may not eat animals with",Elementary Forms
41360,"prominent teeth, because they make him think of his own lost tooth. The",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies of the Kuringal terminate with a ritual washing;[1089],Elementary Forms
41360,acquatic birds are forbidden to the neophyte because they make him think,Elementary Forms
41360,of this rite. Animals that climb to the tops of trees are equally sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"for him, because they are too near to Daramulun, the god of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"initiation, who lives in heaven.[1090] The soul of a dead man is a",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred thing: we have already seen how this same property passes to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"corpse in which the soul resided, to the spot where this is buried, to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the camp in which he lived when alive, and which is either destroyed or",Elementary Forms
41360,"quitted, to the name he bore, to his wife and to his relations.[1091]",Elementary Forms
41360,"They, too, are invested, as it were, with a sacred character;",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently, men keep at a distance from them; they do not treat them",Elementary Forms
41360,"as mere profane beings. In the societies observed by Dawson, their",Elementary Forms
41360,"names, like that of the dead man, cannot be pronounced during the period",Elementary Forms
41360,of mourning.[1092] Certain animals which he ate may also be,Elementary Forms
41360,prohibited.[1093],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This contagiousness of sacredness is too well known a phenomenon[1094],Elementary Forms
41360,to require any proof of its existence from numerous examples; we only,Elementary Forms
41360,wish to show that it is as true in totemism as in the more advanced,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions. When once established, it quickly explains the extreme rigour",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the interdicts separating the sacred from the profane. Since, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"virtue of this extraordinary power of expansion, the slightest contact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the least proximity, either material or simply moral, suffices to draw",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious forces out of their domain, and since, on the other hand, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot leave it without contradicting their nature, a whole system of",Elementary Forms
41360,measures is indispensable for maintaining the two worlds at a respectful,Elementary Forms
41360,"distance from one another. This is why it is forbidden to the profane,",Elementary Forms
41360,"not only to touch, but even to see or hear that which is sacred, and why",Elementary Forms
41360,these two sorts of life cannot be mixed in their consciousnesses.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Precautions are necessary to keep them apart because, though opposing",Elementary Forms
41360,"one another, they tend to confuse themselves into one another.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,When we understand the multiplicity of these interdicts we also,Elementary Forms
41360,understand the way in which they operate and the sanctions which are,Elementary Forms
41360,attached to them. Owing to the contagiousness inherent in all that is,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred, a profane being cannot violate an interdict without having the",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious force, to which he has unduly approached, extend itself over",Elementary Forms
41360,him and establish its empire over him. But as there is an antagonism,Elementary Forms
41360,"between them, he becomes dependent upon a hostile power, whose hostility",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot fail to manifest itself in the form of violent reactions which,Elementary Forms
41360,tend to destroy him. This is why sickness or death are considered the,Elementary Forms
41360,natural consequences of every transgression of this sort; and they are,Elementary Forms
41360,"consequences which are believed to come by themselves, with a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,physical necessity. The guilty man feels himself attacked by a force,Elementary Forms
41360,which dominates him and against which he is powerless. Has he eaten the,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic animal? Then he feels it penetrating him and gnawing at his,Elementary Forms
41360,vitals; he lies down on the ground and awaits death.[1095] Every,Elementary Forms
41360,"profanation implies a consecration, but one which is dreadful, both for",Elementary Forms
41360,the subject consecrated and for those who approach him. It is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"consequences of this consecration which sanction, in part, the",Elementary Forms
41360,interdict.[1096],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It should be noticed that this explanation of the interdicts does not,Elementary Forms
41360,depend upon the variable symbols by the aid of which religious forces,Elementary Forms
41360,are conceived. It matters little whether these are conceived as,Elementary Forms
41360,anonymous and impersonal energies or figured as personalities endowed,Elementary Forms
41360,"with consciousness and feeling. In the former case, of course, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to react against profaning transgressions in an automatic and,Elementary Forms
41360,"unconscious manner, while in the latter case, they are thought to obey",Elementary Forms
41360,"passionate movements determined by the offence resented. But at bottom,",Elementary Forms
41360,"these two conceptions, which, moreover, have the same practical effect,",Elementary Forms
41360,only express one and the same psychic mechanism in two different,Elementary Forms
41360,languages. The basis of both is the antagonism of the sacred and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"profane, combined with the remarkable aptitude of the former for",Elementary Forms
41360,spreading over to the latter; now this antagonism and this,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagiousness act in the same way, whether the sacred character is",Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to blind forces or to conscious ones. Thus, so far is it from",Elementary Forms
41360,being true that the real religious life commences only where there are,Elementary Forms
41360,"mythical personalities, that we see that in this case the rite remains",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same, whether the religious beings are personified or not. This is a",Elementary Forms
41360,statement which we shall have occasion to repeat in each of the chapters,Elementary Forms
41360,which follow.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if this contagiousness of sacredness helps to explain the system of,Elementary Forms
41360,"interdicts, how is it to be explained itself?",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Some have tried to explain it with the well-known laws of the,Elementary Forms
41360,association of ideas. The sentiments inspired in us by a person or a,Elementary Forms
41360,thing spread contagiously from the idea of this thing or person to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"representations associated with it, and thence to the objects which",Elementary Forms
41360,these representations express. So the respect which we have for a sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"being is communicated to everything touching this being, or resembling",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, or recalling it. Of course a cultivated man is not deceived by these",Elementary Forms
41360,associations; he knows that these derived emotions are due to mere plays,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the images and to entirely mental combinations, so he does not give",Elementary Forms
41360,way to the superstitions which these illusions tend to bring about. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"they say that the primitive naively objectifies his impressions, without",Elementary Forms
41360,criticising them. Does something inspire a reverential fear in him? He,Elementary Forms
41360,concludes that an august and redoubtable force really resides in it; so,Elementary Forms
41360,he keeps at a distance from this thing and treats it as though it were,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred, even though it has no right to this title.[1097]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But whoever says this forgets that the most primitive religions are not,Elementary Forms
41360,the only ones which have attributed this power of propagation to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred character. Even in the most recent cults, there is a group of",Elementary Forms
41360,rites which repose upon this principle. Does not every consecration by,Elementary Forms
41360,means of anointing or washing consist in transferring into a profane,Elementary Forms
41360,object the sanctifying virtues of a sacred one? Yet it is difficult to,Elementary Forms
41360,regard an enlightened Catholic of to-day as a sort of retarded savage,Elementary Forms
41360,"who continues to be deceived by his associations of ideas, while nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,in the nature of things explains or justifies these ways of thinking.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, it is quite arbitrarily that they attribute to the primitive",Elementary Forms
41360,this tendency to objectify blindly all his emotions. In his ordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,"life, and in the details of his lay occupations, he does not impute the",Elementary Forms
41360,"properties of one thing to its neighbours, or _vice versa_. If he is",Elementary Forms
41360,"less careful than we are about clarity and distinction, still it is far",Elementary Forms
41360,"from true that he has some vague, deplorable aptitude for jumbling and",Elementary Forms
41360,confusing everything. Religious thought alone has a marked leaning,Elementary Forms
41360,towards these sorts of confusions. So it is in something special to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of religious things, and not in the general laws of the human",Elementary Forms
41360,"intelligence, that the origin of these predispositions is to be sought.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,When a force or property seems to be an integral part or constituent,Elementary Forms
41360,"element of the subject in which it resides, we cannot easily imagine its",Elementary Forms
41360,detaching itself and going elsewhere. A body is defined by its mass and,Elementary Forms
41360,its atomic composition; so we do not think that it could communicate any,Elementary Forms
41360,"of these distinctive characteristics by means of contact. But, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, if we are dealing with a force which has penetrated the body",Elementary Forms
41360,"from without, since nothing attaches it there and since it is foreign to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body, there is nothing inconceivable in its escaping again. Thus the",Elementary Forms
41360,heat or electricity which a body has received from some external source,Elementary Forms
41360,"may be transmitted to the surrounding medium, and the mind readily",Elementary Forms
41360,accepts the possibility of this transmission. So the extreme facility,Elementary Forms
41360,with which religious forces spread out and diffuse themselves has,Elementary Forms
41360,"nothing surprising about it, if they are generally thought of as outside",Elementary Forms
41360,of the beings in which they reside. Now this is just what the theory we,Elementary Forms
41360,have proposed implies.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, they are only collective forces hypostatized, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in,Elementary Forms
41360,"us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the",Elementary Forms
41360,physical world. So they are not homogeneous with the visible things,Elementary Forms
41360,among which we place them. They may well take from these things the,Elementary Forms
41360,"outward and material forms in which they are represented, but they owe",Elementary Forms
41360,none of their efficacy to them. They are not united by external bonds,Elementary Forms
41360,to the different supports upon which they alight; they have no roots,Elementary Forms
41360,there; according to an expression we have already used[1098] and which,Elementary Forms
41360,"serves best for characterizing them, _they are added to them_. So there",Elementary Forms
41360,"are no objects which are predestined to receive them, to the exclusion",Elementary Forms
41360,of all others; even the most insignificant and vulgar may do so;,Elementary Forms
41360,accidental circumstances decide which are the chosen ones. The terms in,Elementary Forms
41360,which Codrington speaks of the mana should be borne in mind: it is a,Elementary Forms
41360,"force, he says, which ""_is not fixed in anything and can be conveyed in",Elementary Forms
41360,"almost anything_.""[1099] Likewise, the Dakota of Miss Fletcher",Elementary Forms
41360,represented the wakan as a sort of surrounding force which is always,Elementary Forms
41360,"coming and going through the world, alighting here and there, but",Elementary Forms
41360,definitely fixing itself nowhere.[1100] Even the religious character,Elementary Forms
41360,inherent in men does not have a different character. There is certainly,Elementary Forms
41360,no other being in the world of experience which is closer to the very,Elementary Forms
41360,"source of all religious life; none participates in it more directly, for",Elementary Forms
41360,it is in human consciousnesses that it is elaborated. Yet we know that,Elementary Forms
41360,"the religious principle animating men, to wit, the soul, is partially",Elementary Forms
41360,external.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if religious forces have a place of their own nowhere, their",Elementary Forms
41360,mobility is easily explained. Since nothing attaches them to the things,Elementary Forms
41360,"in which we localize them, it is natural that they should escape on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"slightest contact, in spite of themselves, so to speak, and that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"should spread afar. Their intensity incites them to this spreading,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which everything favours. This is why the soul itself, though holding to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body by very personal bonds, is constantly threatening to leave it:",Elementary Forms
41360,all the apertures and pores of the body are just so many ways by which,Elementary Forms
41360,it tends to spread and diffuse itself into the outside.[1101],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we shall account for this phenomenon which we are trying to,Elementary Forms
41360,"understand, still better if, instead of considering the notion of",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious forces as it is when completely formulated, we go back to the",Elementary Forms
41360,mental process from which it results.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We have seen, in fact, that the sacred character of a being does not",Elementary Forms
41360,rest in any of its intrinsic attributes. It is not because the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,animal has a certain aspect or property that it inspires religious,Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments; these result from causes wholly foreign to the nature of the,Elementary Forms
41360,object upon which they fix themselves. What constitutes them are the,Elementary Forms
41360,impressions of comfort and dependence which the action of the society,Elementary Forms
41360,"provokes in the mind. Of themselves, these emotions are not attached to",Elementary Forms
41360,the idea of any particular object; but as these emotions exist and are,Elementary Forms
41360,"especially intense, they are also eminently contagious. So they make a",Elementary Forms
41360,stain of oil; they extend to all the other mental states which occupy,Elementary Forms
41360,the mind; they penetrate and contaminate those representations,Elementary Forms
41360,especially in which are expressed the various objects which the man had,Elementary Forms
41360,in his hands or before his eyes at the moment: the totemic designs,Elementary Forms
41360,"covering his body, the bull-roarers which he was making roar, the rocks",Elementary Forms
41360,"surrounding him, the ground under his feet, etc. It is thus that the",Elementary Forms
41360,objects themselves get a religious value which is really not inherent in,Elementary Forms
41360,them but is conferred from without. So the contagion is not a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,"secondary process by which sacredness is propagated, after it has once",Elementary Forms
41360,been acquired; it is the very process by which it is acquired. It is by,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagion that it establishes itself: we should not be surprised,",Elementary Forms
41360,"therefore, if it transmits itself contagiously. What makes its reality",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a special emotion; if it attaches itself to some object, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,because this emotion has found this object in its way. So it is natural,Elementary Forms
41360,that from this one it should spread to all those which it finds in its,Elementary Forms
41360,"neighbourhood, that is to say, to all those which any reason whatsoever,",Elementary Forms
41360,"either material contiguity or mere similarity, has mentally connected",Elementary Forms
41360,with the first.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus, the contagiousness of sacredness finds its explanation in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"theory which we have proposed of religious forces, and by this very",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, it serves to confirm our theory.[1102] And, at the same time, it",Elementary Forms
41360,aids us in understanding a trait of primitive mentality to which we have,Elementary Forms
41360,already called the attention.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have seen[1103] the facility with which the primitive confuses,Elementary Forms
41360,"kingdoms and identifies the most heterogeneous things, men, animals,",Elementary Forms
41360,"plants, stars, etc. Now we see one of the causes which has contributed",Elementary Forms
41360,the most to facilitating these confusions. Since religious forces are,Elementary Forms
41360,"eminently contagious, it is constantly happening that the same principle",Elementary Forms
41360,animates very different objects equally; it passes from some into others,Elementary Forms
41360,as the result of either a simple material proximity or of even a,Elementary Forms
41360,"superficial similarity. It is thus that men, animals, plants and rocks",Elementary Forms
41360,come to have the same totem: the men because they bear the name of the,Elementary Forms
41360,animal: the animals because they bring the totemic emblem to mind; the,Elementary Forms
41360,plants because they nourish these animals; the rocks because they mark,Elementary Forms
41360,the place where the ceremonies are celebrated. Now religious forces are,Elementary Forms
41360,therefore considered the source of all efficacy; so beings having one,Elementary Forms
41360,"single religious principle ought to pass as having the same essence, and",Elementary Forms
41360,as differing from one another only in secondary characteristics. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,why it seemed quite natural to arrange them in a single category and to,Elementary Forms
41360,"regard them as mere varieties of the same class, transmutable into one",Elementary Forms
41360,another.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When this relation has been established, it makes the phenomena of",Elementary Forms
41360,"contagion appear under a new aspect. Taken by themselves, they seem to",Elementary Forms
41360,be quite foreign to the logical life. Is their effect not to mix and,Elementary Forms
41360,"confuse beings, in spite of their natural differences? But we have seen",Elementary Forms
41360,that these confusions and participation have played a role of the,Elementary Forms
41360,highest utility in logic; they have served to bind together things which,Elementary Forms
41360,sensation leaves apart from one another. So it is far from true that,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagion, the source of these connections and confusions, is marked",Elementary Forms
41360,with that fundamental irrationality that one is inclined to attribute it,Elementary Forms
41360,at first. It has opened the way for the scientific explanations of the,Elementary Forms
41360,future.,Elementary Forms

41360,THE POSITIVE CULT,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I.--_The Elements of the Sacrifice_,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Whatever the importance of the negative cult may be, and though it may",Elementary Forms
41360,"indirectly have positive effects, it does not contain its reason for",Elementary Forms
41360,"existence in itself; it introduces one to the religious life, but it",Elementary Forms
41360,supposes this more than it constitutes it. If it orders the worshipper,Elementary Forms
41360,"to flee from the profane world, it is to bring him nearer to the sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,world. Men have never thought that their duties towards religious forces,Elementary Forms
41360,might be reduced to a simple abstinence from all commerce; they have,Elementary Forms
41360,always believed that they upheld positive and bilateral relations with,Elementary Forms
41360,"them, whose regulation and organization is the function of a group of",Elementary Forms
41360,ritual practices. To this special system of rites we give the name of,Elementary Forms
41360,_positive cult_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,For some time we almost completely ignored the positive cult of the,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic religion and what it consists in. We knew almost nothing more,Elementary Forms
41360,"than the initiation rites, and we do not know those sufficiently well",Elementary Forms
41360,"even now. But the observations of Spencer and Gillen, prepared for by",Elementary Forms
41360,"those of Schulze and confirmed by those of Strehlow, on the tribes of",Elementary Forms
41360,"central Australia, have partially filled this gap in our information.",Elementary Forms
41360,There is one ceremony especially which these explorers have taken,Elementary Forms
41360,"particular pains to describe to us and which, moreover, seems to",Elementary Forms
41360,"dominate the whole totemic cult: this is the one that the Arunta,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to Spencer and Gillen, call the _Intichiuma_. It is true that",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow contests the meaning of this word. According to him, intichiuma",Elementary Forms
41360,"(or, as he writes it, _intijiuma_) means ""to instruct"" and designates",Elementary Forms
41360,the ceremonies performed before the young man to teach him the,Elementary Forms
41360,"traditions of the tribe. The feast which we are going to describe bears,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he says, the name _mbatjalkatiuma_, which means ""to fecundate"" or ""to",Elementary Forms
41360,"put into a good condition.""[1104] But we shall not try to settle this",Elementary Forms
41360,"question of vocabulary, which touches the real problem but slightly, as",Elementary Forms
41360,the rites in question are all celebrated in the course of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"initiation. On the other hand, as the word Intichiuma now belongs to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"current language of ethnography, and has almost become a common noun, it",Elementary Forms
41360,seems useless to replace it with another.[1105],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The date on which the Intichiuma takes place depends largely upon the,Elementary Forms
41360,season. There are two sharply separated seasons in Australia: one is dry,Elementary Forms
41360,"and lasts for a long time; the other is rainy and is, on the contrary,",Elementary Forms
41360,"very short and frequently irregular. As soon as the rains arrive,",Elementary Forms
41360,vegetation springs up from the ground as though by enchantment and,Elementary Forms
41360,"animals multiply, so that the country which had recently been only a",Elementary Forms
41360,sterile desert is rapidly filled with a luxurious flora and fauna. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,just at the moment when the good season seems to be close at hand that,Elementary Forms
41360,the Intichiuma is celebrated. But as the rainy season is extremely,Elementary Forms
41360,"variable, the date of the ceremonies cannot be fixed once for all. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"varies with the climatic circumstances, which only the chief of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic group, the Alatunja, is qualified to judge: on a day which he",Elementary Forms
41360,"considers suitable, he informs his companions that the moment has",Elementary Forms
41360,arrived.[1106],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Each totemic group has its own Intichiuma. Even if this rite is general,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the societies of the centre, it is not the same everywhere; among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Warramunga, it is not what it is among the Arunta; it varies, not only",Elementary Forms
41360,"among the tribes, but also within the tribe, among the clans. But it is",Elementary Forms
41360,obvious that the different mechanisms in use are too closely related to,Elementary Forms
41360,"each other to be dissociated completely. There is no ceremony, perhaps,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is not made up of several, though these are very unequally",Elementary Forms
41360,"developed: what exists only as a germ in one, occupies the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"important place in another, and inversely. Yet they must be carefully",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguished, for they constitute just so many different ritual types",Elementary Forms
41360,"to be described and explained separately, but afterwards we must seek",Elementary Forms
41360,some common source from which they were derived.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Let us commence with those observed among the Arunta.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The celebration includes two successive phases. The object of the rites,Elementary Forms
41360,which take place in the first is to assure the prosperity of the animal,Elementary Forms
41360,or vegetable species serving the clan as totem. The means employed for,Elementary Forms
41360,this end may be reduced to two principal types.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It will be remembered that the fabulous ancestors from whom each clan is,Elementary Forms
41360,"supposed to be descended, formerly lived on earth and left traces of",Elementary Forms
41360,their passage there. These traces consist especially in stones and rocks,Elementary Forms
41360,"which they deposited at certain places, or which were formed at the",Elementary Forms
41360,spots where they entered into the ground. These rocks and stones are,Elementary Forms
41360,"considered the bodies or parts of the bodies of the ancestors, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,"memory they keep alive; they represent them. Consequently, they also",Elementary Forms
41360,represent the animals and plants which served these same ancestors as,Elementary Forms
41360,"totems, for an individual and his totem are only one. The same reality",Elementary Forms
41360,and the same properties are attributed to them as to the actually living,Elementary Forms
41360,plants or animals of the same species. But they have this advantage over,Elementary Forms
41360,"these latter, that they are imperishable, knowing neither sickness nor",Elementary Forms
41360,death. So they are like a permanent immutable and ever-available reserve,Elementary Forms
41360,"of animal and vegetable life. Also, in a certain number of cases, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,this reserve that they annually draw upon to assure the reproduction of,Elementary Forms
41360,the species.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Here, for example, is how the Witchetty grub clan, at Alice Springs,",Elementary Forms
41360,proceeds at its Intichiuma.[1107],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"On the day fixed by the chief, all the members of the totemic group",Elementary Forms
41360,assemble in the principal camp. The men of the other totems retire to a,Elementary Forms
41360,"distance;[1108] for among the Arunta, they are not allowed to be present",Elementary Forms
41360,"at the celebration of the rite, which has all the characteristics of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"secret ceremony. An individual of a different totem, but of the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratry, may be invited to be present, as a favour; but this is only as",Elementary Forms
41360,a witness. In no case can he take an active part.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"After the men of the totem have assembled, they leave the camp, leaving",Elementary Forms
41360,only two or three of their number behind. They advance in a profound,Elementary Forms
41360,"silence, one behind another, all naked, without arms and without any of",Elementary Forms
41360,their habitual ornaments. Their attitude and their pace are marked with,Elementary Forms
41360,a religious gravity: this is because the act in which they are taking,Elementary Forms
41360,"part has an exceptional importance in their eyes. Also, until the end of",Elementary Forms
41360,the ceremony they are required to observe a rigorous fast.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The country which they traverse is all filled with souvenirs left by the,Elementary Forms
41360,glorious ancestors. Thus they arrive at a spot where a huge block of,Elementary Forms
41360,"quartz is found, with small round stones all around it. This block",Elementary Forms
41360,represents the witchetty grub as an adult. The Alatunja strikes it with,Elementary Forms
41360,"a sort of wooden tray called _apmara_,[1109] and at the same time he",Elementary Forms
41360,"intones a chant, whose object is to invite the animal to lay eggs. He",Elementary Forms
41360,proceeds in the same fashion with the stones which are regarded as the,Elementary Forms
41360,eggs of the animal and with one of which he rubs the stomach of each,Elementary Forms
41360,"assistant. This done, they all descend a little lower, to the foot of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"cliff also celebrated in the myths of the Alcheringa, at the base of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is another stone, also representing the witchetty grub. The",Elementary Forms
41360,Alatunja strikes it with his apmara; the men accompanying him do so as,Elementary Forms
41360,"well, with branches of a gum-tree which they have gathered on the way,",Elementary Forms
41360,all of which goes on in the midst of chants renewing the invitation,Elementary Forms
41360,previously addressed to the animal. About ten different spots are,Elementary Forms
41360,"visited in turn, some of which are a mile or more from the others. At",Elementary Forms
41360,"each of them there is a stone at the bottom of a cave or hole, which is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to represent the witchetty grub in one of his aspects or at one,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the phases of his existence, and upon each of these stones, the same",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies are repeated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The meaning of the rite is evident. When the Alatunja strikes the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"stones, it is to detach some dust. The grains of this very holy dust are",Elementary Forms
41360,regarded as so many germs of life; each of them contains a spiritual,Elementary Forms
41360,"principle which will give birth to a new being, when introduced into an",Elementary Forms
41360,organism of the same species. The branches with which the assistants are,Elementary Forms
41360,provided serve to scatter this precious dust in all directions; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"scattered everywhere, to accomplish its fecundating work. By this means,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they assure, in their own minds, an abundant reproduction of the animal",Elementary Forms
41360,"species over which the clans guard, so to speak, and upon which it",Elementary Forms
41360,depends.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The natives themselves give the rite this interpretation. Thus, in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"clan of the _ilpirla_ (a kind of ""manna""), they proceed in the following",Elementary Forms
41360,"manner. When the day of the Intichiuma arrives, the group assembles near",Elementary Forms
41360,"a huge rock, about fifty feet high; on top of this rock is another, very",Elementary Forms
41360,similar to the first in aspect and surrounded by other smaller ones.,Elementary Forms
41360,Both represent masses of manna. The Alatunja digs up the ground at the,Elementary Forms
41360,foot of this rock and uncovers a churinga which is believed to have been,Elementary Forms
41360,"buried there in Alcheringa times, and which is, as it were, the",Elementary Forms
41360,quintessence of the manna. Then he climbs up to the summit of the higher,Elementary Forms
41360,"rock and rubs it, first with the churinga and then with the smaller",Elementary Forms
41360,"stones which surround it. Finally, he brushes away the dust which has",Elementary Forms
41360,"thus been collected on the surface of the rock, with the branches of a",Elementary Forms
41360,tree; each of the assistants does the same in his turn. Now Spencer and,Elementary Forms
41360,Gillen say that the idea of the natives is that the dust thus scattered,Elementary Forms
41360,"will ""settle upon the mulga trees and so produce manna."" In fact, these",Elementary Forms
41360,"operations are accompanied by a hymn sung by those present, in which",Elementary Forms
41360,this idea is expressed.[1110],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"With variations, this same rite is found in other societies. Among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Urabunna, there is a rock representing an ancestor of the Lizard clan;",Elementary Forms
41360,"bits are detached from it which they throw in every direction, in order",Elementary Forms
41360,"to secure an abundant production of lizards.[1111] In this same tribe,",Elementary Forms
41360,there is a sand-bank which mythological souvenirs closely associate with,Elementary Forms
41360,"the louse totem. At the same spot are two trees, one of which is called",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ordinary louse tree, the other, the crab-louse tree. They take some",Elementary Forms
41360,"of this sand, rub it on these trees, throw it about on every side and",Elementary Forms
41360,"become convinced that, as a result of this, lice will be born in large",Elementary Forms
41360,numbers.[1112] The Mara perform the Intichiuma of the bees by scattering,Elementary Forms
41360,"dust detached from sacred rocks.[1113] For the kangaroo of the plains, a",Elementary Forms
41360,slightly different method is used. They take some kangaroo-dung and wrap,Elementary Forms
41360,"it up in a certain herb of which the animal is very fond, and which",Elementary Forms
41360,"belongs to the kangaroo totem for this reason. Then they put the dung,",Elementary Forms
41360,"thus enveloped, on the ground between two bunches of this herb and set",Elementary Forms
41360,"the whole thing on fire. With the flame thus made, they light the",Elementary Forms
41360,branches of trees and then whirl them about in such a way that sparks,Elementary Forms
41360,fly in every direction. These sparks play the same role as the dust in,Elementary Forms
41360,the preceding cases.[1114],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In a certain number of clans,[1115] men mix something of their own",Elementary Forms
41360,"substance with that of the stone, in order to make the rite more",Elementary Forms
41360,efficacious. Young men open their veins and let streams of blood flow on,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the rock. This is the case, for example, in the Intichiuma of the",Elementary Forms
41360,Hakea flower among the Arunta. The ceremony takes place in a sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"place around an equally sacred rock which, in the eyes of the natives,",Elementary Forms
41360,"represents Hakea flowers. After certain preliminary operations, ""the old",Elementary Forms
41360,"leader asks one of the young men to open a vein in his arm, which he",Elementary Forms
41360,"does, and allows the blood to sprinkle freely, while the other men",Elementary Forms
41360,continue the singing. The blood flows until the stone is completely,Elementary Forms
41360,"covered.""[1116] The object of this practice is to revivify the virtues",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the stone, after a fashion, and to reinforce its efficacy. It should",Elementary Forms
41360,not be forgotten that the men of the clan are relatives of the plant or,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal whose name they bear; the same principle of life is in them, and",Elementary Forms
41360,especially in their blood. So it is only natural that one should use,Elementary Forms
41360,this blood and the mystic germs which it carries to assure the regular,Elementary Forms
41360,reproduction of the totemic species. It frequently happens among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta that when a man is sick or tired, one of his young companions",Elementary Forms
41360,opens his veins and sprinkles him with his blood in order to reanimate,Elementary Forms
41360,"him.[1117] If blood is able to reawaken life in a man in this way, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,not surprising that it should also be able to awaken it in the animal or,Elementary Forms
41360,vegetable species with which the men of the clan are confounded.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The same process is employed in the Intichiuma of the Undiara kangaroo,Elementary Forms
41360,among the Arunta. The theatre of the ceremony is a water-hole vaulted,Elementary Forms
41360,over by a peaked rock. This rock represents an animal-kangaroo of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Alcheringa which was killed and deposited there by a man-kangaroo of the,Elementary Forms
41360,same epoch; many kangaroo spirits are also believed to reside there.,Elementary Forms
41360,After a certain number of sacred stones have been rubbed against each,Elementary Forms
41360,"other in the way we have described, several of the assistants climb up",Elementary Forms
41360,"on the rock upon which they let their blood flow.[1118] ""The purpose of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ceremony at the present day, so say the natives, is by means of",Elementary Forms
41360,"pouring out the blood of kangaroo men upon the rock, to drive out in all",Elementary Forms
41360,directions the spirits of the kangaroo animals and so to increase the,Elementary Forms
41360,"number of the animals.""[1119]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,There is even one case among the Arunta where the blood seems to be the,Elementary Forms
41360,"active principle in the rite. In the Emu group, they do not use sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,stones or anything resembling them. The Alatunja and some of his,Elementary Forms
41360,assistants sprinkle the ground with their blood; on the ground thus,Elementary Forms
41360,"soaked, they trace lines in various colours, representing the different",Elementary Forms
41360,parts of the body of an emu. They kneel down around this design and,Elementary Forms
41360,chant a monotonous hymn. From the fictitious emu to which this chant is,Elementary Forms
41360,"addressed, and, consequently, from the blood which has served to make",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, they believe that vivifying principles go forth, which animate the",Elementary Forms
41360,"embryos of the new generation, and thus prevent the species from",Elementary Forms
41360,disappearing.[1120],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Wonkgongaru,[1121] there is one clan whose totem is a certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"kind of fish; in the Intichiuma of this totem also, it is the blood that",Elementary Forms
41360,"plays the principal part. The chief of the group, after being",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremoniously painted, goes into a pool of water and sits down there.",Elementary Forms
41360,Then he pierces his scrotum and the skin around his navel with small,Elementary Forms
41360,"pointed bones. ""The blood from the wounds goes into the water and gives",Elementary Forms
41360,"rise to fish.""[1122]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By a wholly similar process, the Dieri think that they assure the",Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduction of two of their totems, the carpet snake and the woma snake",Elementary Forms
41360,(the ordinary snake). A Mura-mura named Minkani is thought to live under,Elementary Forms
41360,a dune. His body is represented by some fossil bones of animals or,Elementary Forms
41360,"reptiles, such as the deltas of the rivers flowing into Lake Eyre",Elementary Forms
41360,"contain, according to Howitt. When the day of the ceremony arrives, the",Elementary Forms
41360,men assemble and go to the home of the Minkani. There they dig until,Elementary Forms
41360,"they come to a layer of damp earth which they call ""the excrement of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Minkani."" From now on, they continue to turn up the soil with great care",Elementary Forms
41360,"until they uncover ""the elbow of Minkani."" Then two young men open their",Elementary Forms
41360,veins and let their blood flow on to the sacred rock. They chant the,Elementary Forms
41360,"hymn of Minkani while the assistants, carried away in a veritable",Elementary Forms
41360,"frenzy, beat each other with their arms. The battle continues until they",Elementary Forms
41360,"get back to the camp, which is about a mile away. Here, the women",Elementary Forms
41360,intervene and put an end to the combat. They collect the blood which has,Elementary Forms
41360,"flown from the wounds, mix it with the ""excrement of Minkani,"" and",Elementary Forms
41360,scatter the resulting mixture over the dune. When this rite has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"accomplished, they are convinced that carpet snakes will be born in",Elementary Forms
41360,abundance.[1123],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In certain cases, they use the very substance which they wish to produce",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the vivifying principle. Thus among the Kaitish, in the course of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony whose object is to create rain, they sprinkle water over a",Elementary Forms
41360,sacred rock which represents the mythical heroes of the Water clan. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is evident that they believe that by this means they augment the,Elementary Forms
41360,"productive virtues of the rock just as well as with blood, and for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same reasons.[1124] Among the Mara, the actor takes water from a sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,"hole, puts it in his mouth and spits it out in every direction.[1125]",Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Worgaia, when the yams begin to sprout, the chief of the Yam",Elementary Forms
41360,clan sends men of the phratry of which he is not a member himself to,Elementary Forms
41360,"gather some of these plants; these bring some to him, and ask him to",Elementary Forms
41360,"intervene, in order that the species may develop well. He takes one,",Elementary Forms
41360,"chews it, and throws the bits in every direction.[1126] Among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Kaitish when, after various rites which we shall not describe, the grain",Elementary Forms
41360,"of a certain grass called Erlipinna has reached its full development,",Elementary Forms
41360,the chief of the totem brings a little of it to camp and grinds it,Elementary Forms
41360,"between two stones; the dust thus obtained is piously gathered up, and a",Elementary Forms
41360,"few grains are placed on the lips of the chief, who scatters them by",Elementary Forms
41360,"blowing. This contact with the mouth of the chief, which has a very",Elementary Forms
41360,"special sacramental virtue, undoubtedly has the object of stimulating",Elementary Forms
41360,"the vitality of the germs which these grains contain and which, being",Elementary Forms
41360,"blown to all the quarters of the horizon, go to communicate these",Elementary Forms
41360,fecundating virtues which they possess to the plants.[1127],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The efficacy of these rites is never doubted by the native: he is,Elementary Forms
41360,"convinced that they must produce the results he expects, with a sort of",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity. If events deceive his hopes, he merely concludes that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"were counteracted by the sorcery of some hostile group. In any case, it",Elementary Forms
41360,never enters his mind that a favourable result could be obtained by any,Elementary Forms
41360,other means. If by chance the vegetation grows or the animals produce,Elementary Forms
41360,"before he has performed his Intichiuma, he supposes that another",Elementary Forms
41360,Intichiuma has been celebrated under the ground by the ancestors and,Elementary Forms
41360,that the living reap the benefits of this subterranean ceremony.[1128],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is the first act of the celebration.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"During the period immediately following, there are no regular",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies. However, the religious life remains intense: this is",Elementary Forms
41360,manifested especially by an aggravation of the system of interdicts. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is as though the sacred character of the totem were reinforced: they do,Elementary Forms
41360,"not even dare to touch it. In ordinary times, the Arunta may eat the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal or plant which serves as totem, provided they do so with",Elementary Forms
41360,"moderation, but on the morrow of the Intichiuma this right is suspended;",Elementary Forms
41360,the alimentary interdiction is strict and without exceptions. They,Elementary Forms
41360,believe that any violation of this interdict would result in,Elementary Forms
41360,neutralizing the good effects of the rite and in preventing the increase,Elementary Forms
41360,of the species. It is true that the men of other totems who happen to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the same locality are not submitted to the same prohibition. However,",Elementary Forms
41360,their liberty is less than ordinary at this time. They may not consume,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic animal wherever they place, in the brush, for example; they",Elementary Forms
41360,"must bring it to camp, and it is there only that it may be cooked.[1129]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A final ceremony terminates this period of extraordinary interdictions,Elementary Forms
41360,and definitely closes this long series of rites. It varies somewhat in,Elementary Forms
41360,"different clans, but the essential elements are the same everywhere.",Elementary Forms
41360,Here are the two principal forms which it takes among the Arunta. One of,Elementary Forms
41360,"these is in connection with the witchetty grub, the other with the",Elementary Forms
41360,kangaroo.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When the grubs have attained full maturity and appear in abundance, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"men of the totem, as well as others, collect as many of them as",Elementary Forms
41360,possible; then they all bring those they have found back to camp and,Elementary Forms
41360,cook them until they become hard and brittle. They are then preserved in,Elementary Forms
41360,wooden vessels called _pitchi_. The harvest of grubs is possible only,Elementary Forms
41360,"during a very short time, for they appear only after the rain. When they",Elementary Forms
41360,"begin to be less numerous, the Alatunja summons everybody to the camp;",Elementary Forms
41360,"on his invitation, each one brings his supply. The others place theirs",Elementary Forms
41360,before the men of that totem. The Alatunja takes one of these _pitchi_,Elementary Forms
41360,"and, with the aid of his companions, he grinds its contents between two",Elementary Forms
41360,"stones; after this, he eats a little of the powder thus obtained, his",Elementary Forms
41360,"assistants do the same, and what remains is given to the men of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"other clans, who may now dispose of it freely. They proceed in exactly",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same manner with the supply provided by the Alatunja. From now on,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the men and women of the totem may eat it, but only a little at a time;",Elementary Forms
41360,"if they went beyond the limits allowed, they would lose the powers",Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to celebrate the Intichiuma and the species would not,Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduce. Yet, if they did not eat any at all, and especially if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Alatunja ate none in the circumstances we have just described, they",Elementary Forms
41360,would be overtaken by the same incapacity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the totemic group of the Kangaroo, which has its centre at Undiara,",Elementary Forms
41360,certain characteristics of the ceremony are more clearly marked. After,Elementary Forms
41360,the rites which we have described have been accomplished on the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"rock, the young men go and hunt the kangaroo, bringing their game back",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the camp. Here, the old men, with the Alatunja in their midst, eat a",Elementary Forms
41360,"little of the flesh of the animal, and anoint the bodies of those who",Elementary Forms
41360,took part in the Intichiuma with its fat. The rest is divided up among,Elementary Forms
41360,"the men assembled. Next, the men of the totem decorate themselves with",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic designs and the night is passed in songs commemorating the,Elementary Forms
41360,exploits accomplished by men and animal kangaroos in the times of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Alcheringa. The next day, the young men go hunting again in the forest",Elementary Forms
41360,"and bring back a larger number of kangaroos than the first time, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies of the day before recommence.[1130],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"With variations of detail, the same rite is found in other Arunta",Elementary Forms
41360,"clans,[1131] among the Urabunna,[1132] the Kaitish,[1133] the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Unmatjera,[1134] and in the Encounter Bay Tribe.[1135] Everywhere, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,made up of the same essential elements. A few specimens of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal or plant are presented to the chief of the clan, who solemnly",Elementary Forms
41360,"eats them and who must eat them. If he did not fulfil this duty, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"would lose the power of celebrating the Intichiuma efficaciously, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, so as to recreate the species annually. Sometimes the ritual",Elementary Forms
41360,consumption is followed by an unction made with the fat of the animal or,Elementary Forms
41360,certain parts of the plant.[1136] This rite is generally repeated by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"men of the totem, or at least by the old men, and after it has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"accomplished, the exceptional interdictions are raised.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the tribes located farther north, among the Warramunga and",Elementary Forms
41360,"neighbouring societies,[1137] this ceremony is no longer found. However,",Elementary Forms
41360,traces are found which seem to indicate that there was a time when it,Elementary Forms
41360,was known. It is true that the chief of the clan never eats the totem,Elementary Forms
41360,"ritually and obligatorily. But in certain cases, men who are not of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem whose Intichiuma has just been celebrated, must bring the animal",Elementary Forms
41360,"or plant to camp and offer it to the chief, asking him if he wants to",Elementary Forms
41360,"eat it. He refuses and adds, ""I have made this for you; you may eat it",Elementary Forms
41360,"freely.""[1138] So the custom of the presentation remains and the",Elementary Forms
41360,question asked of the chief seems to date back to an epoch when the,Elementary Forms
41360,ritual consumption was practised.[1139],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The interest of the system of rites which has just been described lies,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the fact that in them we find, in the most elementary form that is",Elementary Forms
41360,"actually known, all the essential principles of a great religious",Elementary Forms
41360,institution which was destined to become one of the foundation stones of,Elementary Forms
41360,the positive cult in the superior religions: this is the institution of,Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifice.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We know what a revolution the work of Robertson Smith brought about in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the traditional theory of sacrifice.[1140] Before him, sacrifice was",Elementary Forms
41360,"regarded as a sort of tribute or homage, either obligatory or optional,",Elementary Forms
41360,analogous to that which subjects owe to their princes. Robertson Smith,Elementary Forms
41360,was the first to remark that this classic explanation did not account,Elementary Forms
41360,"for two essential characteristics of the rite. In the first place, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"a repast: its substance is food. Secondly, it is a repast in which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"worshippers who offer it take part, along with the god to whom it is",Elementary Forms
41360,offered. Certain parts of the victim are reserved for the divinity;,Elementary Forms
41360,"others are attributed to the sacrificers, who consume them; this is why",Elementary Forms
41360,the Bible often speaks of the sacrifice as a repast in the presence of,Elementary Forms
41360,"Jahveh. Now in a multitude of societies, meals taken in common are",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to create a bond of artificial kinship between those who assist,Elementary Forms
41360,"at them: In fact, relatives are people who are naturally made of the",Elementary Forms
41360,same flesh and blood. But food is constantly remaking the substance of,Elementary Forms
41360,the organism. So a common food may produce the same effects as a common,Elementary Forms
41360,"origin. According to Smith, sacrificial banquets have the object of",Elementary Forms
41360,"making the worshipper and his god communicate in the same flesh, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"order to form a bond of kinship between them. From this point of view,",Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifice takes on a wholly new aspect. Its essential element is no,Elementary Forms
41360,longer the act of renouncement which the word sacrifice ordinarily,Elementary Forms
41360,"expresses; before all, it is an act of alimentary communion.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Of course there are some reservations to be made in the details of this,Elementary Forms
41360,way of explaining the efficacy of sacrificial banquets. This does not,Elementary Forms
41360,result exclusively from the act of eating together. A man does not,Elementary Forms
41360,"sanctify himself merely by sitting down, in some way, at the same table",Elementary Forms
41360,"with a god, but especially by eating food at this ritual repast which",Elementary Forms
41360,has a sacred character. It has been shown how a whole series of,Elementary Forms
41360,"preliminary operations, lustrations, unctions, prayers, etc., transform",Elementary Forms
41360,"the animal to be immolated into a sacred thing, whose sacredness is",Elementary Forms
41360,subsequently transferred to the worshipper who eats it.[1141] But it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"true, none the less, that the alimentary communion is one of the",Elementary Forms
41360,essential elements of the sacrifice. Now when we turn to the rite which,Elementary Forms
41360,"terminates the ceremonies of the Intichiuma, we find that it, too,",Elementary Forms
41360,consists in an act of this sort. After the totemic animal has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"killed, the Alatunja and the old men solemnly eat it. So they",Elementary Forms
41360,communicate with the sacred principle residing in it and they assimilate,Elementary Forms
41360,it. The only difference we find here is that the animal is naturally,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred while it ordinarily acquires this character artificially in the,Elementary Forms
41360,course of the sacrifice.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the object of this communion is manifest. Every member of a",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic clan contains a mystic substance within him which is the,Elementary Forms
41360,"pre-eminent part of his being, for his soul is made out of it. From it",Elementary Forms
41360,"come whatever powers he has and his social position, for it is this",Elementary Forms
41360,which makes him a person. So he has a vital interest in maintaining it,Elementary Forms
41360,"intact and in keeping it, as far as is possible, in a state of perpetual",Elementary Forms
41360,"youth. Unfortunately all forces, even the most spiritual, are used up in",Elementary Forms
41360,the course of time if nothing comes to return to them the energy they,Elementary Forms
41360,lose through the normal working of things; there is a necessity of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"first importance here which, as we shall see, is the real reason for the",Elementary Forms
41360,positive cult. Therefore the men of a totem cannot retain their position,Elementary Forms
41360,unless they periodically revivify the totemic principle which is in,Elementary Forms
41360,them; and as they represent this principle in the form of a vegetable or,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal, it is to the corresponding animal or vegetable species that they",Elementary Forms
41360,go to demand the supplementary forces needed to renew this and to,Elementary Forms
41360,rejuvenate it. A man of the Kangaroo clan believes himself and feels,Elementary Forms
41360,himself a kangaroo; it is by this quality that he defines himself; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"this which marks his place in the society. In order to keep it, he takes",Elementary Forms
41360,a little of the flesh of this same animal into his own body from time to,Elementary Forms
41360,"time. A small bit is enough, owing to the rule: _the part is equal to",Elementary Forms
41360,the whole_.[1142],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If this operation is to produce all the desired effects, it may not take",Elementary Forms
41360,place at no matter what moment. The most opportune time is when the new,Elementary Forms
41360,"generation has just reached its complete development, for this is also",Elementary Forms
41360,the moment when the forces animating the totemic species attain their,Elementary Forms
41360,maximum intensity. They have just been drawn with great difficulty from,Elementary Forms
41360,"those rich reservoirs of life, the sacred trees and rocks. Moreover, all",Elementary Forms
41360,sorts of means have been employed to increase their intensity still,Elementary Forms
41360,more; this is the use of the rites performed during the first part of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Intichiuma. Also, by their very aspect, the firstfruits of the",Elementary Forms
41360,harvest manifest the energy which they contain: here the totemic god,Elementary Forms
41360,acclaims himself in all the glory of his youth. This is why the,Elementary Forms
41360,"firstfruits have always been regarded as a very sacred fruit, reserved",Elementary Forms
41360,for very holy beings. So it is natural that the Australian uses it to,Elementary Forms
41360,regenerate himself spiritually. Thus both the date and the circumstances,Elementary Forms
41360,of the ceremonies are explained.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Perhaps some will be surprised that so sacred a food may be eaten by,Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinary profane persons. But in the first place, there is no positive",Elementary Forms
41360,cult which does not face this contradiction. Every sacred being is,Elementary Forms
41360,removed from profane touch by this very character with which it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"endowed; but, on the other hand, they would serve for nothing and have",Elementary Forms
41360,no reason whatsoever for their existence if they could not come in,Elementary Forms
41360,"contact with these same worshippers who, on another ground, must remain",Elementary Forms
41360,"respectfully distant from them. At bottom, there is no positive rite",Elementary Forms
41360,"which does not constitute a veritable sacrilege, for a man cannot hold",Elementary Forms
41360,commerce with the sacred beings without crossing the barrier which,Elementary Forms
41360,should ordinarily keep them separate. But the important thing is that,Elementary Forms
41360,the sacrilege should be accompanied with precautions which attenuate,Elementary Forms
41360,"it. Among those employed, the most usual one consists in arranging the",Elementary Forms
41360,transition so as to introduce the worshipper slowly and gradually into,Elementary Forms
41360,the circle of sacred things. When it has been broken and diluted in this,Elementary Forms
41360,"fashion, the sacrilege does not offend the religious conscience so",Elementary Forms
41360,violently; it is not regarded as a sacrilege and so vanishes. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,what happens in the case now before us. The effect of the whole series,Elementary Forms
41360,of rites which has preceded the moment when the totem is solemnly eaten,Elementary Forms
41360,has been to sanctify those who took an active part in them. They,Elementary Forms
41360,"constitute an essentially religious period, through which no one could",Elementary Forms
41360,"go without a transformation of his religious state. The fasts, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contact with sacred rocks, the churinga,[1143] the totemic decorations,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc., have gradually conferred upon him a character which he did not",Elementary Forms
41360,"have before and which enables him to approach, without a shocking and",Elementary Forms
41360,"dangerous profanation, this desirable and redoubtable food which is",Elementary Forms
41360,forbidden him in ordinary times.[1144],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If the act by which a sacred being is first immolated and then eaten by,Elementary Forms
41360,"those who adore it may be called a sacrifice, the rite of which we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"just been speaking has a right to this same name. Moreover, its",Elementary Forms
41360,significance is well shown by the striking analogies it presents with so,Elementary Forms
41360,many practices met with in a large number of agrarian cults. It is a,Elementary Forms
41360,very general rule that even among peoples who have attained a high,Elementary Forms
41360,"degree of civilization, the firstfruits of the harvest are used in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual repasts, of which the pascal feast is the best known",Elementary Forms
41360,"example.[1145] On the other hand, as the agrarian rites are at the very",Elementary Forms
41360,"basis of the most advanced forms of the cult, we see that the Intichiuma",Elementary Forms
41360,of the Australian societies is closer to us than one might imagine from,Elementary Forms
41360,its apparent crudeness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"By an intuition of genius, Smith had an intuition of all this, though he",Elementary Forms
41360,was not acquainted with the facts. By a series of ingenious,Elementary Forms
41360,"deductions--which need not be reproduced here, for their interest is now",Elementary Forms
41360,only historical[1146]--he thought that he could establish the fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,at the beginning the animal immolated in the sacrifice must have been,Elementary Forms
41360,regarded as quasi-divine and as a close relative of those who immolated,Elementary Forms
41360,it: now these characteristics are just the ones with which the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,species is defined. Smith even went so far as to suppose that totemism,Elementary Forms
41360,must have known and practised a rite wholly similar to the one we have,Elementary Forms
41360,been studying; he was even inclined to see the original source of the,Elementary Forms
41360,whole sacrificial institution in a sacrifice of this sort.[1147],Elementary Forms
41360,Sacrifice was not founded to create a bond of artificial kinship between,Elementary Forms
41360,"a man and his gods, but to maintain and renew the natural kinship which",Elementary Forms
41360,"primitively united them. Here, as elsewhere, the artifice was born only",Elementary Forms
41360,to imitate nature. But in the book of Smith this hypothesis was,Elementary Forms
41360,presented as scarcely more than a theory which the then known facts,Elementary Forms
41360,supported very imperfectly. The rare cases of totemic sacrifice which he,Elementary Forms
41360,cites in support of his theory do not have the significance he,Elementary Forms
41360,attributed to them; the animals which figure in them are not real,Elementary Forms
41360,totems.[1148] But to-day we are able to state that on at least one point,Elementary Forms
41360,"the demonstration is made: in fact, we have just seen that in an",Elementary Forms
41360,"important number of societies the totemic sacrifice, such as Smith",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived it, is or has been practised. Of course, we have no proof that",Elementary Forms
41360,this practice is necessarily inherent to totemism or that it is the germ,Elementary Forms
41360,out of which all the other types of sacrifices have developed. But if,Elementary Forms
41360,"the universality of the rite is hypothetical, its existence is no longer",Elementary Forms
41360,to be contested. Hereafter it is to be regarded as established that the,Elementary Forms
41360,most mystical form of the alimentary communion is found even in the most,Elementary Forms
41360,rudimentary cults known to-day.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But on another point the new facts at our disposal invalidate the,Elementary Forms
41360,theories of Smith.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to him, the communion was not only an essential element of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrifice, but at the beginning, at least, it was the unique element.",Elementary Forms
41360,Not only is one mistaken when he reduces sacrifice to nothing more than,Elementary Forms
41360,"a tribute or offering, but the very idea of an offering was originally",Elementary Forms
41360,absent from it; this intervened only at a late period and under the,Elementary Forms
41360,influence of external circumstances; so instead of being able to aid us,Elementary Forms
41360,"in understanding it, it has rather masked the real nature of the ritual",Elementary Forms
41360,"mechanism. In fact, Smith claimed to find in the very notion of oblation",Elementary Forms
41360,an absurdity so revolting that it could never have been the fundamental,Elementary Forms
41360,reason for so great an institution. One of the most important functions,Elementary Forms
41360,incumbent upon the divinity is to assure to men that food which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary for life; so it seems impossible that the sacrifice, in its",Elementary Forms
41360,"turn, should consist in a presentation of food to the divinity. It even",Elementary Forms
41360,seems self-contradictory that the gods should expect their food from a,Elementary Forms
41360,"man, when it is from them that he gets his. Why should they have need of",Elementary Forms
41360,his aid in order to deduct beforehand their just share of the things,Elementary Forms
41360,which he receives from their hands? From these considerations Smith,Elementary Forms
41360,concluded that the idea of a sacrifice-offering could have been born,Elementary Forms
41360,"only in the great religions, where the gods, removed from the things",Elementary Forms
41360,"with which they were primitively confused, were thought of as sorts of",Elementary Forms
41360,kings and the eminent proprietors of the earth and its products. From,Elementary Forms
41360,"this moment onwards, the sacrifice was associated with the tribute which",Elementary Forms
41360,"subjects paid to their prince, as a price of the rights which were",Elementary Forms
41360,conceded to them. But this new interpretation was really an alteration,Elementary Forms
41360,"and even a corruption of the primitive conception. For ""the idea of",Elementary Forms
41360,"property materializes all that it touches""; by introducing itself into",Elementary Forms
41360,"the sacrifice, it denatured it and made it into a sort of bargain",Elementary Forms
41360,between the man and the divinity.[1149],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the facts which we have described overthrow this argumentation.,Elementary Forms
41360,These rites are certainly among the most primitive that have ever been,Elementary Forms
41360,observed. No determined mythical personality appears in them; there is,Elementary Forms
41360,no question of gods or spirits that are properly so called; it is only,Elementary Forms
41360,vaguely anonymous and impersonal forces which they put into action. Yet,Elementary Forms
41360,the reasoning which they suppose is exactly the one that Smith declared,Elementary Forms
41360,impossible because of its absurdity.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Let us return to the first act of the Intichiuma, to the rites destined",Elementary Forms
41360,to assure the fecundity of the animal or vegetable species which serves,Elementary Forms
41360,the clan as totem. This species is the pre-eminently sacred thing; in it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is incarnated that which we have been able to call, by metaphor, the",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic divinity. Yet we have seen that to perpetuate itself it has need,Elementary Forms
41360,of the aid of men. It is they who dispense the life of the new,Elementary Forms
41360,"generation each year; without them, it would never be born. If they",Elementary Forms
41360,"stopped celebrating the Intichiuma, the sacred beings would disappear",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the face of the earth. So in one sense, it is from men that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"get their existence; yet in another way, it is from them that men get",Elementary Forms
41360,"theirs; for after they have once arrived at maturity, it is from them",Elementary Forms
41360,that men acquire the force needed to support and repair their spiritual,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings. Thus we are able to say that men make their gods, or, at least,",Elementary Forms
41360,"make them live; but at the same time, it is from them that they live",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves. So they are regularly guilty of the circle which, according",Elementary Forms
41360,"to Smith, is implied in the very idea of a sacrificial tribute: they",Elementary Forms
41360,"give to the sacred beings a little of what they receive from them, and",Elementary Forms
41360,they receive from them all that they give.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there is still more to be said: the oblations which he is thus,Elementary Forms
41360,forced to make every year do not differ in nature from those which are,Elementary Forms
41360,made later in the rites properly called sacrifices. If the sacrificer,Elementary Forms
41360,"immolates an animal, it is in order that the living principles within it",Elementary Forms
41360,may be disengaged from the organism and go to nourish the divinity.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Likewise, the grains of dust which the Australian detaches from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred rock are so many sacred principles which he scatters into space,",Elementary Forms
41360,so that they may go to animate the totemic species and assure its,Elementary Forms
41360,renewal. The gesture with which this scattering is made is also that,Elementary Forms
41360,"which normally accompanies offerings. In certain cases, the resemblance",Elementary Forms
41360,between the two rites may be followed even to the details of the,Elementary Forms
41360,movements effected. We have seen that in order to have rain the Kaitish,Elementary Forms
41360,"pour water over the sacred stone; among certain peoples, the priest",Elementary Forms
41360,"pours water over the altar, with the same end in view.[1150] The",Elementary Forms
41360,effusions of blood which are usual in a certain number of Intichiuma are,Elementary Forms
41360,veritable oblations. Just as the Arunta or Dieri sprinkle the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"rock or the totemic design with blood, so it frequently happens that in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the more advanced cults, the blood of the sacrificed victim or of the",Elementary Forms
41360,worshipper himself is spilt before or upon the altar.[1151] In these,Elementary Forms
41360,"cases, it is given to the gods, of whom it is the preferred food; in",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australia, it is given to the sacred species. So we have no ground for",Elementary Forms
41360,saying that the idea of oblation is a late product of civilization.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A document which we owe to Strehlow puts this kinship of the Intichiuma,Elementary Forms
41360,and the sacrifice clearly into evidence. This is a hymn which,Elementary Forms
41360,accompanies the Intichiuma of the Kangaroo; the ceremony is described at,Elementary Forms
41360,the same time that its expected effects are announced. A morsel of,Elementary Forms
41360,kangaroo fat has been placed by the chief upon a support made of,Elementary Forms
41360,branches. The text says that this fat makes the fat of the kangaroos,Elementary Forms
41360,"increase.[1152] This time, they do not confine themselves to sprinkling",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacred dust or human blood about; the animal itself is immolated, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrificed as one might say, placed upon a sort of altar, and offered to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the species, whose life it should maintain.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now we see the sense in which we may say that the Intichiuma contains,Elementary Forms
41360,the germs of the sacrificial system. In the form which it takes when,Elementary Forms
41360,"fully constituted, a sacrifice is composed of two essential elements: an",Elementary Forms
41360,act of communion and an act of oblation. The worshipper communes with,Elementary Forms
41360,"his god by taking in a sacred food, and at the same time he makes an",Elementary Forms
41360,"offering to this god. We find these two acts in the Intichiuma, as we",Elementary Forms
41360,have described it. The only difference is that in the ordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifice[1153] they are made simultaneously or else follow one another,Elementary Forms
41360,"immediately, while in the Australian ceremony they are separated. In the",Elementary Forms
41360,"former case, they are parts of one undivided rite; here, they take place",Elementary Forms
41360,"at different times, and may even be separated by a rather long interval.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But, at bottom, the mechanism is the same. Taken as a whole, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Intichiuma is a sacrifice, but one whose parts are not yet articulated",Elementary Forms
41360,and organized.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The relating of these two ceremonies has the double advantage of,Elementary Forms
41360,enabling us to understand better the nature of the Intichiuma and that,Elementary Forms
41360,of sacrifice.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We understand the Intichiuma better. In fact, the conception of Frazer,",Elementary Forms
41360,which made it a simple magic operation[1154] with no religious character,Elementary Forms
41360,"at all, is now seen to be unsupportable. One cannot dream of excluding",Elementary Forms
41360,from religion a rite which is the forerunner of so great a religious,Elementary Forms
41360,institution.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we also understand what the sacrifice itself is better. In the first,Elementary Forms
41360,"place, the equal importance of the two elements entering into it is now",Elementary Forms
41360,"established. If the Australian makes offerings to his sacred beings,",Elementary Forms
41360,there is no reason for supposing that the idea of oblation was foreign,Elementary Forms
41360,to the primitive organization of the sacrificial institution and later,Elementary Forms
41360,upset its natural arrangement. The theory of Smith must be revised on,Elementary Forms
41360,this point.[1155] Of course the sacrifice is partially a communion; but,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is also, and no less essentially, a gift and an act of renouncement.",Elementary Forms
41360,It always presupposes that the worshipper gives some of his substance or,Elementary Forms
41360,his goods to his gods. Every attempt to deduce one of these elements,Elementary Forms
41360,from the other is hopeless. Perhaps the oblation is even more permanent,Elementary Forms
41360,than the communion.[1156],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the second place, it ordinarily seems as though the sacrifice, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"especially the sacrificial oblation, could only be addressed to personal",Elementary Forms
41360,beings. But the oblations which we have met with in Australia imply no,Elementary Forms
41360,"notion of this sort. In other words, the sacrifice is independent of the",Elementary Forms
41360,varying forms in which the religious forces are conceived; it is founded,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon more profound reasons, which we shall seek presently.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In any case, it is clear that the act of offering naturally arouses in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the mind the idea of a moral subject, whom this offering is destined to",Elementary Forms
41360,please. The ritual acts which we have described become more,Elementary Forms
41360,intelligible when it is believed that they are addressed to persons. So,Elementary Forms
41360,"the practices of the Intichiuma, while actually putting only impersonal",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces into play, prepare the way for a different conception.[1157] Of",Elementary Forms
41360,course they were not sufficient to form the idea of mythical,Elementary Forms
41360,"personalities by themselves, but when this idea had once been formed,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the very nature of these rites made it enter into the cult; thus, taking",Elementary Forms
41360,"a more direct interest in action and life, it also acquired a greater",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality. So we are even able to believe that the cult favoured, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"secondary manner, no doubt, but nevertheless one which is worthy of",Elementary Forms
41360,"attention, the personification of the religious forces.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,V,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we still have to explain the contradiction in which Robertson Smith,Elementary Forms
41360,saw an inadmissible logical scandal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If the sacred beings always manifested their powers in a perfectly equal,Elementary Forms
41360,"manner, it would appear inconceivable that men should dream of offering",Elementary Forms
41360,"them services, for we cannot see what need they could have of them. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the first place, in so far as they are confused with things, and in",Elementary Forms
41360,"so far as they are regarded as principles of the cosmic life, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves submitted to the rhythm of this life. Now this goes in,Elementary Forms
41360,"oscillations in contrary directions, which succeed one another according",Elementary Forms
41360,to a determined law. Sometimes it is affirmed in all its glory;,Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes it weakens to such an extent that one may ask himself whether,Elementary Forms
41360,it is not going to fade away. Vegetation dies every year; will it be,Elementary Forms
41360,reborn? Animal species tend to become extinguished by the effect of,Elementary Forms
41360,natural and violent death; will they be renewed at such a time and in,Elementary Forms
41360,"such a way as is proper? Above all, the rain is capricious; there are",Elementary Forms
41360,long periods during which it seems to have disappeared for ever. These,Elementary Forms
41360,periodical variations of nature bear witness to the fact that at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponding periods, the sacred beings upon whom the plants, animals,",Elementary Forms
41360,"rain, etc., depend are themselves passing through grave crises; so they,",Elementary Forms
41360,"too, have their periods of giving way. But men could not regard these",Elementary Forms
41360,"spectacles as indifferent spectators. If he is to live, the universal",Elementary Forms
41360,"life must continue, and consequently the gods must not die. So he seeks",Elementary Forms
41360,"to sustain and aid them; for this, he puts at their service whatever",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces he has at his disposition, and mobilizes them for this purpose.",Elementary Forms
41360,The blood flowing in his veins has fecundating virtues; he pours it,Elementary Forms
41360,forth. From the sacred rocks possessed by his clan he takes those germs,Elementary Forms
41360,"of life which lie dormant there, and scatters them into space. In a",Elementary Forms
41360,"word, he makes oblations.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The external and physical crises, moreover, duplicate internal and",Elementary Forms
41360,mental crises which tend toward the same result. Sacred beings exist,Elementary Forms
41360,only when they are represented as such in the mind. When we cease to,Elementary Forms
41360,"believe in them, it is as though they did not exist. Even those which",Elementary Forms
41360,"have a material form and are given by sensible experience, depend upon",Elementary Forms
41360,the thought of the worshippers who adore them; for the sacred character,Elementary Forms
41360,which makes them objects of the cult is not given by their natural,Elementary Forms
41360,constitution; it is added to them by belief. The kangaroo is only an,Elementary Forms
41360,"animal like all others; yet, for the men of the Kangaroo, it contains",Elementary Forms
41360,"within it a principle which puts it outside the company of others, and",Elementary Forms
41360,this principle exists only in the minds of those who believe in,Elementary Forms
41360,"it.[1158] If these sacred beings, when once conceived, are to have no",Elementary Forms
41360,"need of men to continue, it would be necessary that the representations",Elementary Forms
41360,expressing them always remain the same. But this stability is,Elementary Forms
41360,"impossible. In fact, it is in the communal life that they are formed,",Elementary Forms
41360,and this communal life is essentially intermittent. So they necessarily,Elementary Forms
41360,partake of this same intermittency. They attain their greatest intensity,Elementary Forms
41360,at the moment when the men are assembled together and are in immediate,Elementary Forms
41360,"relations with one another, when they all partake of the same idea and",Elementary Forms
41360,the same sentiment. But when the assembly has broken up and each man has,Elementary Forms
41360,"returned to his own peculiar life, they progressively lose their",Elementary Forms
41360,original energy. Being covered over little by little by the rising flood,Elementary Forms
41360,"of daily experiences, they would soon fall into the unconscious, if we",Elementary Forms
41360,did not find some means of calling them back into consciousness and,Elementary Forms
41360,"revivifying them. If we think of them less forcefully, they amount to",Elementary Forms
41360,less for us and we count less upon them; they exist to a lesser degree.,Elementary Forms
41360,"So here we have another point of view, from which the services of men",Elementary Forms
41360,are necessary to them. This second reason for their existence is even,Elementary Forms
41360,"more important than the first, for it exists all the time. The",Elementary Forms
41360,intermittency of the physical life can affect religious beliefs only,Elementary Forms
41360,when religions are not yet detached from their cosmic basis. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"intermittency of the social life, on the other hand, is inevitable; even",Elementary Forms
41360,the most idealistic religions cannot escape it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, it is owing to this state of dependency upon the thought of",Elementary Forms
41360,"men, in which the gods find themselves, that the former are able to",Elementary Forms
41360,believe in the efficacy of their assistance. The only way of renewing,Elementary Forms
41360,the collective representations which relate to sacred beings is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"retemper them in the very source of the religious life, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,in the assembled groups. Now the emotions aroused by these periodical,Elementary Forms
41360,crises through which external things pass induce the men who witness,Elementary Forms
41360,"them to assemble, to see what should be done about it. But by the very",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact of uniting, they are mutually comforted; they find a remedy because",Elementary Forms
41360,they seek it together. The common faith becomes reanimated quite,Elementary Forms
41360,naturally in the heart of this reconstituted group; if is born again,Elementary Forms
41360,because it again finds those very conditions in which it was born in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"first place. After it has been restored, it easily triumphs over all the",Elementary Forms
41360,private doubts which may have arisen in individual minds. The image of,Elementary Forms
41360,the sacred things regains power enough to resist the internal or,Elementary Forms
41360,external causes which tended to weaken it. In spite of their apparent,Elementary Forms
41360,"failure, men can no longer believe that the gods will die, because they",Elementary Forms
41360,feel them living in their own hearts. The means employed to succour,Elementary Forms
41360,"them, howsoever crude these may be, cannot appear vain, for everything",Elementary Forms
41360,goes on as if they were really effective. Men are more confident because,Elementary Forms
41360,"they feel themselves stronger; and they really are stronger, because",Elementary Forms
41360,forces which were languishing are now reawakened in the consciousness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So we must be careful not to believe, along with Smith, that the cult",Elementary Forms
41360,was founded solely for the benefit of men and that the gods have nothing,Elementary Forms
41360,to do with it: they have no less need of it than their worshippers. Of,Elementary Forms
41360,"course men would be unable to live without gods, but, on the other hand,",Elementary Forms
41360,the gods would die if their cult were not rendered. This does not have,Elementary Forms
41360,the sole object of making profane subjects communicate with sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings, but it also keeps these latter alive and is perpetually remaking",Elementary Forms
41360,and regenerating them. Of course it is not the material oblations which,Elementary Forms
41360,bring about this regeneration by their own virtues; it is the mental,Elementary Forms
41360,"states which these actions, though vain in themselves, accompany or",Elementary Forms
41360,"reawaken. The real reason for the existence of the cults, even of those",Elementary Forms
41360,"which are the most materialistic in appearance, is not to be sought in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the acts which they prescribe, but in the internal and moral",Elementary Forms
41360,regeneration which these acts aid in bringing about. The things which,Elementary Forms
41360,the worshipper really gives his gods are not the foods which he places,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon the altars, nor the blood which he lets flow from his veins: it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"his thought. Nevertheless, it is true that there is an exchange of",Elementary Forms
41360,"services, which are mutually demanded, between the divinity and its",Elementary Forms
41360,"worshippers. The rule _do ut des_, by which the principle of sacrifice",Elementary Forms
41360,"has sometimes been defined, is not a late invention of utilitarian",Elementary Forms
41360,theorists: it only expresses in an explicit way the very mechanism of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the sacrificial system and, more generally, of the whole positive cult.",Elementary Forms
41360,So the circle pointed out by Smith is very real; but it contains nothing,Elementary Forms
41360,humiliating for the reason. It comes from the fact that the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings, though superior to men, can live only in the human",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But this circle will appear still more natural to us, and we shall",Elementary Forms
41360,"understand its meaning and the reason for its existence still better if,",Elementary Forms
41360,carrying our analysis still farther and substituting for the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"symbols the realities which they represent, we investigate how these",Elementary Forms
41360,"behave in the rite. If, as we have attempted to establish, the sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,principle is nothing more nor less than society transfigured and,Elementary Forms
41360,"personified, it should be possible to interpret the ritual in lay and",Elementary Forms
41360,"social terms. And, as a matter of fact, social life, just like the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual, moves in a circle. On the one hand, the individual gets from",Elementary Forms
41360,"society the best part of himself, all that gives him a distinct",Elementary Forms
41360,"character and a special place among other beings, his intellectual and",Elementary Forms
41360,"moral culture. If we should withdraw from men their language, sciences,",Elementary Forms
41360,"arts and moral beliefs, they would drop to the rank of animals. So the",Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristic attributes of human nature come from society. But, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, society exists and lives only in and through individuals. If",Elementary Forms
41360,the idea of society were extinguished in individual minds and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs, traditions and aspirations of the group were no longer felt and",Elementary Forms
41360,"shared by the individuals, society would die. We can say of it what we",Elementary Forms
41360,just said of the divinity: it is real only in so far as it has a place,Elementary Forms
41360,"in human consciousnesses, and this place is whatever one we may give it.",Elementary Forms
41360,We now see the real reason why the gods cannot do without their,Elementary Forms
41360,worshippers any more than these can do without their gods; it is because,Elementary Forms
41360,"society, of which the gods are only a symbolic expression, cannot do",Elementary Forms
41360,without individuals any more than these can do without society.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Here we touch the solid rock upon which all the cults are built and,Elementary Forms
41360,which has caused their persistence ever since human societies have,Elementary Forms
41360,existed. When we see what religious rites consist of and towards what,Elementary Forms
41360,"they seem to tend, we demand with astonishment how men have been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,"imagine them, and especially how they can remain so faithfully attached",Elementary Forms
41360,to them. Whence could the illusion have come that with a few grains of,Elementary Forms
41360,"sand thrown to the wind, or a few drops of blood shed upon a rock or the",Elementary Forms
41360,"stone of an altar, it is possible to maintain the life of an animal",Elementary Forms
41360,species or of a god? We have undoubtedly made a step in advance towards,Elementary Forms
41360,"the solution of this problem when we have discovered, behind these",Elementary Forms
41360,"outward and apparently unreasonable movements, a mental mechanism which",Elementary Forms
41360,gives them a meaning and a moral significance. But we are in no way,Elementary Forms
41360,assured that this mechanism itself does not consist in a simple play of,Elementary Forms
41360,hallucinatory images. We have pointed out the psychological process,Elementary Forms
41360,which leads the believers to imagine that the rite causes the spiritual,Elementary Forms
41360,forces of which they have need to be reborn about them; but it does not,Elementary Forms
41360,follow from the fact that this belief is psychologically explicable that,Elementary Forms
41360,it has any objective value. If we are to see in the efficacy attributed,Elementary Forms
41360,to the rites anything more than the product of a chronic delirium with,Elementary Forms
41360,"which humanity has abused itself, we must show that the effect of the",Elementary Forms
41360,cult really is to recreate periodically a moral being upon which we,Elementary Forms
41360,depend as it depends upon us. Now this being does exist: it is society.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Howsoever little importance the religious ceremonies may have, they put",Elementary Forms
41360,the group into action; the groups assemble to celebrate them. So their,Elementary Forms
41360,"first effect is to bring individuals together, to multiply the relations",Elementary Forms
41360,between them and to make them more intimate with one another. By this,Elementary Forms
41360,"very fact, the contents of their consciousnesses is changed. On ordinary",Elementary Forms
41360,"days, it is utilitarian and individual avocations which take the greater",Elementary Forms
41360,part of the attention. Every one attends to his own personal business;,Elementary Forms
41360,"for most men, this primarily consists in satisfying the exigencies of",Elementary Forms
41360,"material life, and the principal incentive to economic activity has",Elementary Forms
41360,always been private interest. Of course social sentiments could never be,Elementary Forms
41360,"totally absent. We remain in relations with others; the habits, ideas",Elementary Forms
41360,and tendencies which education has impressed upon us and which,Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinarily preside over our relations with others, continue to make",Elementary Forms
41360,their action felt. But they are constantly combated and held in check by,Elementary Forms
41360,the antagonistic tendencies aroused and supported by the necessities of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the daily struggle. They resist more or less successfully, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,their intrinsic energy: but this energy is not renewed. They live upon,Elementary Forms
41360,"their past, and consequently they would be used up in the course of",Elementary Forms
41360,"time, if nothing returned to them a little of the force that they lose",Elementary Forms
41360,"through these incessant conflicts and frictions. When the Australians,",Elementary Forms
41360,"scattered in little groups, spend their time in hunting and fishing,",Elementary Forms
41360,they lose sight of what concerns their clan or tribe: their only thought,Elementary Forms
41360,"is to catch as much game as possible. On feast days, on the contrary,",Elementary Forms
41360,these preoccupations are necessarily eclipsed; being essentially,Elementary Forms
41360,"profane, they are excluded from these sacred periods. At this time,",Elementary Forms
41360,"their thoughts are centred upon their common beliefs, their common",Elementary Forms
41360,"traditions, the memory of their great ancestors, the collective ideal",Elementary Forms
41360,"of which they are the incarnation; in a word, upon social things. Even",Elementary Forms
41360,the material interests which these great religious ceremonies are,Elementary Forms
41360,designed to satisfy concern the public order and are therefore social.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Society as a whole is interested that the harvest be abundant, that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rain fall at the right time and not excessively, that the animals",Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce regularly. So it is society that is in the foreground of every,Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness; It dominates and directs all conduct; this is equivalent,Elementary Forms
41360,"to saying that it is more living and active, and consequently more real,",Elementary Forms
41360,than in profane times. So men do not deceive themselves when they feel,Elementary Forms
41360,at this time that there is something outside of them which is born,Elementary Forms
41360,"again, that there are forces which are reanimated and a life which",Elementary Forms
41360,reawakens. This renewal is in no way imaginary and the individuals,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves profit from it. For the spark of a social being which each,Elementary Forms
41360,bears within him necessarily participates in this collective renovation.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The individual soul is regenerated too, by being dipped again in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"source from which its life comes; consequently it feels itself stronger,",Elementary Forms
41360,"more fully master of itself, less dependent upon physical necessities.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We know that the positive cult naturally tends to take periodic forms;,Elementary Forms
41360,this is one of its distinctive features. Of course there are rites which,Elementary Forms
41360,"men celebrate occasionally, in connection with passing situations. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"these episodic practices are always merely accessory, and in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"religions studied in this book, they are almost exceptional. The",Elementary Forms
41360,essential constituent of the cult is the cycle of feasts which return,Elementary Forms
41360,regularly at determined epochs. We are now able to understand whence,Elementary Forms
41360,this tendency towards periodicity comes; the rhythm which the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"life follows only expresses the rhythm of the social life, and results",Elementary Forms
41360,from it. Society is able to revivify the sentiment it has of itself only,Elementary Forms
41360,by assembling. But it cannot be assembled all the time. The exigencies,Elementary Forms
41360,of life do not allow it to remain in congregation indefinitely; so it,Elementary Forms
41360,"scatters, to assemble anew when it again feels the need of this. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,to these necessary alternations that the regular alternations of sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"and profane times correspond. Since the apparent object, at least, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the cult was at first to regularize the course of natural phenomena, the",Elementary Forms
41360,rhythm of the cosmic life has put its mark on the rhythm of the ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,life. This is why the feasts have long been associated with the seasons;,Elementary Forms
41360,we have seen this characteristic already in the Intichiuma of Australia.,Elementary Forms
41360,But the seasons have only furnished the outer frame-work for this,Elementary Forms
41360,"organization, and not the principle upon which it rests; for even the",Elementary Forms
41360,cults which aim at exclusively spiritual ends have remained periodical.,Elementary Forms
41360,So this periodicity must be due to other causes. Since the seasonal,Elementary Forms
41360,"changes are critical periods for nature, they are a natural occasion for",Elementary Forms
41360,"assembling, and consequently for religious ceremonies. But other events",Elementary Forms
41360,can and have successfully fulfilled this function of occasional cause.,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it must be recognized that this frame-work, though purely",Elementary Forms
41360,"external, has given proof of a singular resistive force, for traces of",Elementary Forms
41360,it are found even in the religions which are the most fully detached,Elementary Forms
41360,"from all physical bases. Many Christian celebrations are founded, with",Elementary Forms
41360,"no break of continuity, on the pastoral and agrarian feasts of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancient Hebrews, although in themselves they are neither pastoral nor",Elementary Forms
41360,agrarian.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, this rhythm is capable of varying in different societies.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Where the period of dispersion is long, and the dispersion itself is",Elementary Forms
41360,"extreme, the period of congregation, in its turn, is very prolonged, and",Elementary Forms
41360,produces veritable debauches of collective and religions life. Feasts,Elementary Forms
41360,"succeed one another for weeks or even for months, while the ritual life",Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes attains to a sort of frenzy. This is what happens among the,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian tribes and many of the tribes of North-western America.[1159],Elementary Forms
41360,"Elsewhere, on the contrary, these two phases of the social life succeed",Elementary Forms
41360,"one another after shorter intervals, and then the contrast between them",Elementary Forms
41360,"is less marked. The more societies develop, the less they seem to allow",Elementary Forms
41360,of too great intermittences.,Elementary Forms

41360,But the processes which we have just been describing are not the only,Elementary Forms
41360,ones employed to assure the fecundity of the totemic species. There are,Elementary Forms

41360,"In the very ceremonies which we have been describing, in addition to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"oblations, whether bloody or otherwise, there are other rites which are",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently celebrated, whose object is to complete the former ones and",Elementary Forms
41360,to consolidate their effects. They consist in movements and cries whose,Elementary Forms
41360,object is to imitate the different attitudes and aspects of the animal,Elementary Forms
41360,"whose reproduction is desired; therefore, we shall call them",Elementary Forms
41360,_imitative_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the Intichiuma of the Witchetty grub among the Arunta includes more,Elementary Forms
41360,"than the rites performed upon the sacred rocks, of which we have already",Elementary Forms
41360,"spoken. When these are finished, the men set out to return to camp; but",Elementary Forms
41360,"when they still are about a mile away, they halt and all decorate",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves ritually; after this, the march is resumed. The decorations",Elementary Forms
41360,with which they thus adorn themselves announce that an important,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony is going to take place. And, in fact, while the company was",Elementary Forms
41360,"absent, one of the old men who had been left to guard the camp had built",Elementary Forms
41360,"a shelter out of branches, called _Umbana_, which represented the",Elementary Forms
41360,chrysalis out of which the insect comes. All of those who had taken part,Elementary Forms
41360,in the previous ceremonies assemble near the spot where this,Elementary Forms
41360,"construction has been raised; then they advance slowly, stopping from",Elementary Forms
41360,"time to time, until they reach the _Umbana_, which they enter. At once",Elementary Forms
41360,all the men who do not belong to the phratry of the Witchetty grub,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem, and who assist at the scene, though from a distance, lie down on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ground, with their faces against the earth; they must remain in this",Elementary Forms
41360,position without moving until they are allowed to get up again.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Meanwhile, a chant arises from the interior of the Umbana, which",Elementary Forms
41360,describes the different phases through which the animal passes in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"course of its development, and the myths of which the sacred rocks are",Elementary Forms
41360,"the subject. When this hymn ceases, the Alatunja glides out of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"_Umbana_, though remaining in a squatting position, and advances slowly",Elementary Forms
41360,over the ground before him; he is followed by all his companions who,Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce gestures whose evident object is to represent the insect as it,Elementary Forms
41360,"leaves the chrysalis. Also, a hymn which is heard at just this moment",Elementary Forms
41360,"and which is like an oral commentary on the rite, consists in a",Elementary Forms
41360,description of the movements made by the insect at this stage of its,Elementary Forms
41360,development.[1160],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Another Intichiuma,[1161] celebrated in connection with another kind of",Elementary Forms
41360,"grub, the _unchalka_[1162] grub, has this character still more clearly.",Elementary Forms
41360,The actors of this rite decorate themselves with designs representing,Elementary Forms
41360,the _unchalka_ bush upon which this grub lives at the beginning of its,Elementary Forms
41360,"existence. Then they cover a buckler with concentric circles of down,",Elementary Forms
41360,representing another kind of bush upon which the insect lays its eggs,Elementary Forms
41360,"when it has become adult. When all these preparations are finished, they",Elementary Forms
41360,all sit down on the ground in a semicircle facing the principal,Elementary Forms
41360,officiant. He alternately bends his body double by leaning towards the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ground and then rises on his knees; at the same time, he shakes his",Elementary Forms
41360,"stretched-out arms, which is a way of representing the wings of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"insect. From time to time, he leans over the buckler, imitating the way",Elementary Forms
41360,in which the butterfly flies over the trees where it lays its eggs. When,Elementary Forms
41360,"this ceremony is finished, another commences at a different spot, to",Elementary Forms
41360,which they go in silence. This time they use two bucklers. Upon one the,Elementary Forms
41360,"tracks of the grub are represented by zigzag lines; upon the other,",Elementary Forms
41360,concentric circles of uneven dimensions represent the eggs of the insect,Elementary Forms
41360,"and the seed of the Eremophile bush, upon which it is nourished. As in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the former ceremony, they all sit down in silence while the officiant",Elementary Forms
41360,"acts, representing the movements of the animal when leaving its",Elementary Forms
41360,chrysalis and taking its first flight.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Spencer and Gillen also point out certain analogous facts among the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta, though these are of a minor importance: in the Intichiuma of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Emu, for example, at a certain moment the actors try to reproduce by",Elementary Forms
41360,their attitude the air and aspect of this bird;[1163] in the Intichiuma,Elementary Forms
41360,"of water, the men of the totem utter the characteristic cry of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"plover, a cry which is naturally associated in the mind with the rainy",Elementary Forms
41360,"season.[1164] But in all, the examples of imitative rites which these",Elementary Forms
41360,"two explorers have noted are rather few in number. However, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,certain that their relative silence on this point is due either to their,Elementary Forms
41360,not having observed the Intichiuma sufficiently or else to their having,Elementary Forms
41360,"neglected this side of the ceremonies; Schulze, on the other hand, has",Elementary Forms
41360,been struck by the essentially imitative nature of the Arunta rites.,Elementary Forms
41360,"""The sacred corrobbori,"" he says, ""are generally ceremonies representing",Elementary Forms
41360,"animals"": he calls them _animal tjurunga_[1165] and his testimony is now",Elementary Forms
41360,confirmed by the documents collected by Strehlow. The examples given by,Elementary Forms
41360,this latter author are so numerous that it is impossible to cite them,Elementary Forms
41360,all: there are scarcely any ceremonies in which some imitating gesture,Elementary Forms
41360,is not pointed out. According to the nature of the animals whose feast,Elementary Forms
41360,"is celebrated, they jump after the manner of kangaroos, or imitate the",Elementary Forms
41360,"movements they make in eating, the flight of winged ants, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristic noise of the bat, the cry of the wild turkey, the hissing",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the snake, the croaking of the frog, etc.[1166] When the totem is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"plant, they make the gesture of plucking it,[1167] or eating it,[1168]",Elementary Forms
41360,etc.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Warramunga, the Intichiuma generally takes a special form,",Elementary Forms
41360,which we shall describe in the next chapter and which differs from those,Elementary Forms
41360,"which we have studied up to the present. However, there is one typical",Elementary Forms
41360,case of a purely imitative Intichiuma among this people; it is that of,Elementary Forms
41360,the black cockatoo. The ceremony described by Spencer and Gillen,Elementary Forms
41360,commenced at ten o'clock in the evening. All night long the chief of the,Elementary Forms
41360,clan imitated the cry of the bird with a disheartening monotony. He,Elementary Forms
41360,"stopped only when he had come to the end of his force, and then his son",Elementary Forms
41360,replaced him; then he commenced again as soon as he felt a little,Elementary Forms
41360,refreshed. These exhausting exercises continued until morning without,Elementary Forms
41360,interruption.[1169],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Living beings are not the only ones which they try to imitate. In a,Elementary Forms
41360,"large number of tribes, the Intichiuma of rain consists essentially in",Elementary Forms
41360,imitative rites. One of the most simple of these is that celebrated,Elementary Forms
41360,"among the Arabunna. The chief of the clan is seated on the ground, all",Elementary Forms
41360,covered with white down and holding a lance in his hands. He shakes,Elementary Forms
41360,"himself, undoubtedly in order to detach from his body the down which is",Elementary Forms
41360,fixed there and which represents clouds when scattered about in the air.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus he imitates the men-clouds of the Alcheringa who, according to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"legend, had the habit of ascending to heaven and forming clouds there,",Elementary Forms
41360,"from which the rain then fell. In a word, the object of the whole rite",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to represent the formation and ascension of clouds, the bringers of",Elementary Forms
41360,rain.[1170],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The ceremony is much more complicated among the Kaitish. We have already,Elementary Forms
41360,spoken of one of the means employed: the officiant pours water over the,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred stones and himself. But the action of this sort of oblation is,Elementary Forms
41360,reinforced by other rites. The rainbow is considered to have a close,Elementary Forms
41360,connection with rain: they say that it is its son and that it is always,Elementary Forms
41360,"urged to appear to make the rain stop. To make the rain fall, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,therefore necessary that it should not appear; they believe that this,Elementary Forms
41360,result can be obtained in the following manner. A design representing a,Elementary Forms
41360,"rainbow is made upon a buckler. They carry this buckler to camp, taking",Elementary Forms
41360,care to keep it hidden from all eyes. They are convinced that by making,Elementary Forms
41360,"this image of the rainbow invisible, they keep the rainbow itself from",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearing. Meanwhile, the chief of the clan, having beside him a",Elementary Forms
41360,"_pitchi_ full of water, throws in all directions flakes of down which",Elementary Forms
41360,represent clouds. Repeated imitations of the cry of the plover complete,Elementary Forms
41360,"this ceremony, which seems to have an especial gravity; for as long as",Elementary Forms
41360,"it lasts, all those who participate in it, either as actors or",Elementary Forms
41360,"assistants, may have no relations whatsoever with their wives; they may",Elementary Forms
41360,not even speak to them.[1171],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The processes of figuration are different among the Dieri. Rain is not,Elementary Forms
41360,"represented by water, but by blood, which the men cause to flow from",Elementary Forms
41360,their veins on to the assistants.[1172] At the same time they throw,Elementary Forms
41360,"handfuls of white down about, which represent clouds. A hut has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"constructed previously, in which they now place two large stones",Elementary Forms
41360,"representing piles of clouds, a sign of rain. After they have been left",Elementary Forms
41360,"there for a little while, they are carried a little distance away and",Elementary Forms
41360,placed as high as possible in the loftiest tree to be found; this is a,Elementary Forms
41360,way of making the clouds mount into the sky. Powdered gypsum is then,Elementary Forms
41360,"thrown into a water-hole, for when he sees this, the rain spirit soon",Elementary Forms
41360,"makes the clouds appear. Finally all the men, young and old, assemble",Elementary Forms
41360,"around the hut and with heads lowered, they charge upon it; they rush",Elementary Forms
41360,"violently through it, repeating the operation several times, until",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing remains of the whole construction except the supporting posts.,Elementary Forms
41360,Then they fall upon these and shake and pull at them until the whole,Elementary Forms
41360,thing has tumbled down. The operation consisting in running through the,Elementary Forms
41360,hut is supposed to represent clouds bursting; the tumbling down of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"construction, the fall of rain.[1173]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the north-western tribes studied by Clement,[1174] which occupy the",Elementary Forms
41360,"district included between the Fontescue and Fitzroy rivers, certain",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies are celebrated whose object is exactly the same as that of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Intichiuma of the Arunta, and which seem to be, for the most part,",Elementary Forms
41360,essentially imitative.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These peoples give the name _tarlow_ to certain piles of stones which,Elementary Forms
41360,"are evidently sacred, for, as we shall see, they are the object of",Elementary Forms
41360,"important rites. Every animal, every plant, and in fact, every totem or",Elementary Forms
41360,"sub-totem,[1175] is represented by a _tarlow_ which a special clan[1176]",Elementary Forms
41360,guards. The analogy between these _tarlow_ and the sacred rocks of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Arunta is easily seen.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When kangaroos, for example, become rare, the chief of the clan to which",Elementary Forms
41360,the _tarlow_ of the kangaroo belongs goes to it with a certain number of,Elementary Forms
41360,"companions. Here various rites are performed, the chief of which consist",Elementary Forms
41360,"in jumping around the _tarlow_ as kangaroos jump, in drinking as they",Elementary Forms
41360,"drink and, in a word, in imitating all their most characteristic",Elementary Forms
41360,movements. The weapons used in hunting the animal have an important part,Elementary Forms
41360,"in these rites. They brandish them, throw them against the stones, etc.",Elementary Forms
41360,"When they are concerned for emus, they go to the _tarlow_ of the emu,",Elementary Forms
41360,and walk and run as these birds do. The skill which the natives show in,Elementary Forms
41360,"these imitations is, as it appears, really remarkable.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Other _tarlow_ are consecrated to plants, such as the cereals. In this",Elementary Forms
41360,"case, they imitate the actions of threshing and grinding the grain.",Elementary Forms
41360,Since in ordinary life it is the women who are normally charged with,Elementary Forms
41360,"these tasks, it is also they who perform the rite, in the midst of songs",Elementary Forms
41360,and dances.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,All these rites belong to the same type. The principle upon which they,Elementary Forms
41360,rest is one of those at the basis of what is commonly and incorrectly,Elementary Forms
41360,called sympathetic[1177] magic.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These principles are ordinarily reduced to two.[1178],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The first may be stated thus: _anything touching an object also touches,Elementary Forms
41360,everything which has any relation of proximity or unity whatsoever with,Elementary Forms
41360,"this object_. Thus, whatever affects the part also affects the whole;",Elementary Forms
41360,any action exercised over an individual is transmitted to his,Elementary Forms
41360,"neighbours, relatives and all those to whom he is united in any way. All",Elementary Forms
41360,"these cases are simple applications of the law of contagion, which we",Elementary Forms
41360,have already studied. A condition or a good or bad quality are,Elementary Forms
41360,communicated contagiously from one subject to another who has some,Elementary Forms
41360,connection with the former.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The second principle is ordinarily summed up in the formula: _like,Elementary Forms
41360,produces like_. The representation of a being or condition produces this,Elementary Forms
41360,being or condition. This is the maxim which brings about the rites which,Elementary Forms
41360,"we have just been describing, and it is in them that we can best observe",Elementary Forms
41360,"its characteristics. The classical example of the magic charm, which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinarily given as the typical application of this same precept, is",Elementary Forms
41360,"much less significant. The charm is, to a large extent, a simple",Elementary Forms
41360,phenomenon of transfer. The idea of the image is associated in the mind,Elementary Forms
41360,with that of the model; consequently the effects of an action performed,Elementary Forms
41360,upon a statue are transmitted contagiously to the person whose traits it,Elementary Forms
41360,reproduces. The function of the image is for its original what that of a,Elementary Forms
41360,part is for the whole: it is an agent of transmission. Therefore men,Elementary Forms
41360,think that they can obtain the same result by burning the hair of the,Elementary Forms
41360,person whom they wish to injure: the only difference between these two,Elementary Forms
41360,"sorts of operations is that in one, the communication is made through",Elementary Forms
41360,"similarity, while in the other it is by means of contiguity. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,different with the rites which concern us. They suppose not only the,Elementary Forms
41360,"displacement of a given condition or quality, which passes from one",Elementary Forms
41360,"object into the other, but also the creation of something entirely new.",Elementary Forms
41360,The mere act of representing the animal gives birth to this animal and,Elementary Forms
41360,"creates it; by imitating the sound of wind or falling water, they cause",Elementary Forms
41360,"clouds to form, rain to fall, etc. Of course resemblance plays an",Elementary Forms
41360,"important part in each case, but not at all the same one. In a charm, it",Elementary Forms
41360,only gives a special direction to the action exercised; it directs in a,Elementary Forms
41360,certain way an action not originating in it. In the rites of which we,Elementary Forms
41360,"have just been speaking, it acts by itself and is directly efficacious.",Elementary Forms
41360,"So, in contradiction to the usual definitions, the real difference",Elementary Forms
41360,between the two principles of the so-called sympathetic magic and the,Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding practices is not that it is contiguity acts in one case,Elementary Forms
41360,"and resemblance in the other, but that in the former there is a simple",Elementary Forms
41360,"contagious communication, while there is production and creation in the",Elementary Forms
41360,latter.[1179],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The explanation of imitative rites therefore implies the explanation of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the second of these principles, and reciprocally.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We shall not tarry long to discuss the explanation proposed by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"anthropological school, and especially by Tylor and Frazer. Just as in",Elementary Forms
41360,"their attempts to account for the contagiousness of a sacred character,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they invoke the association of ideas. ""Hom[oe]opathic magic,"" says",Elementary Forms
41360,"Frazer, who prefers this expression to imitative magic, ""is founded on",Elementary Forms
41360,the association of ideas by similarity; contagious magic is founded on,Elementary Forms
41360,the association of ideas by contiguity. Hom[oe]opathic magic commits the,Elementary Forms
41360,mistake of assuming that things which resemble each other are the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same.""[1180] But this is a misunderstanding of the special nature of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"practices under discussion. On the one hand, the formula of Frazer may",Elementary Forms
41360,"be applied with some fitness to the case of charms;[1181] here, in fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"two distinct things are associated with each other, owing to their",Elementary Forms
41360,partial resemblance: these are the image and the model which it,Elementary Forms
41360,"represents more or less systematically. But in the imitative rites,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which we have just been observing, the image alone is given; as for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"model, it does not exist, for the new generation of the totemic species",Elementary Forms
41360,is as yet only a hope and even an uncertain hope at that. So there could,Elementary Forms
41360,"be no question of association, whether correct or not; there is a real",Elementary Forms
41360,"creation, and we cannot see how the association of ideas could possibly",Elementary Forms
41360,lead to a belief in this creation. How could the mere act of,Elementary Forms
41360,representing the movements of an animal bring about the certitude that,Elementary Forms
41360,"this animal will be born, and born in abundance?",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The general properties of human nature cannot explain such special,Elementary Forms
41360,practices. So instead of considering the principle upon which they rest,Elementary Forms
41360,"in its general and abstract form, let us replace it in the environment",Elementary Forms
41360,"of which it is a part and where we have been observing it, and let us",Elementary Forms
41360,connect it with the system of ideas and sentiments which the above rites,Elementary Forms
41360,"put into practice, and then we shall be better able to perceive the",Elementary Forms
41360,causes from which it results.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The men who assemble on the occasion of these rites believe that they,Elementary Forms
41360,are really animals or plants of the species whose name they bear. They,Elementary Forms
41360,"feel within them an animal or vegetable nature, and in their eyes, this",Elementary Forms
41360,is what constitutes whatever is the most essential and the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"excellent in them. So when they assemble, their first movement ought to",Elementary Forms
41360,be to show each other this quality which they attribute to themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,and by which they are defined. The totem is their rallying sign; for,Elementary Forms
41360,"this reason, as we have seen, they design it upon their bodies; but it",Elementary Forms
41360,is no less natural that they should seek to resemble it in their,Elementary Forms
41360,"gestures, their cries, their attitude. Since they are emus or kangaroos,",Elementary Forms
41360,they comport themselves like the animals of the same name. By this,Elementary Forms
41360,"means, they mutually show one another that they are all members of the",Elementary Forms
41360,same moral community and they become conscious of the kinship uniting,Elementary Forms
41360,them. The rite does not limit itself to expressing this kinship; it,Elementary Forms
41360,makes it or remakes it. For it exists only in so far as it is believed,Elementary Forms
41360,"in, and the effect of all these collective demonstrations is to support",Elementary Forms
41360,"the beliefs upon which they are founded. Therefore, these leaps, these",Elementary Forms
41360,"cries and these movements of every sort, though bizarre and grotesque in",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearance, really have a profound and human meaning. The Australian",Elementary Forms
41360,seeks to resemble his totem just as the faithful in more advanced,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions seek to resemble their God. For the one as for the other, this",Elementary Forms
41360,"is a means of communicating with the sacred being, that is to say, with",Elementary Forms
41360,the collective ideal which this latter symbolizes. This is an early form,Elementary Forms
41360,of the [Greek: homoiosis to theo].,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, as this first reason is connected with the most specialized",Elementary Forms
41360,"portions of the totemic beliefs, the principle by which like produces",Elementary Forms
41360,"like should not have survived totemism, if this had been the only one in",Elementary Forms
41360,operation. Now there is probably no religion in which rites derived from,Elementary Forms
41360,it are not found. So another reason must co-operate with this first one.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"And, in fact, the ceremonies where we have seen it applied do not merely",Elementary Forms
41360,"have the very general object which we have just mentioned, howsoever",Elementary Forms
41360,essential this may be; they also aim at a more immediate and more,Elementary Forms
41360,"conscious end, which is the assurance of the reproduction of the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,species. The idea of this necessary reproduction haunts the minds of the,Elementary Forms
41360,worshippers: upon it the forces of their attention and will are,Elementary Forms
41360,concentrated. Now a single preoccupation cannot possess a group of men,Elementary Forms
41360,to this point without being externalized in a material form. Since all,Elementary Forms
41360,"think of the animal or plant to whose destinies the clan is united, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is inevitable that this common thought should not be manifested,Elementary Forms
41360,"outwardly by gestures,[1182] and those naturally designated for this",Elementary Forms
41360,office are those which represent this animal or plant in one of its most,Elementary Forms
41360,characteristic attitudes; there are no other movements so close to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"idea filling every mind, for these are an immediate and almost automatic",Elementary Forms
41360,translation of it. So they make themselves imitate the animal; they cry,Elementary Forms
41360,"like it, they jump like it; they reproduce the scenes in which they make",Elementary Forms
41360,daily use of the plant. All these ways of representation are just so,Elementary Forms
41360,many means of ostensibly showing the end towards which all minds are,Elementary Forms
41360,"directed, of telling the thing which they wish to realize, of calling it",Elementary Forms
41360,"up and of evoking it. And this need belongs to no one time, nor does it",Elementary Forms
41360,depend upon the beliefs of any special religion; it is essentially,Elementary Forms
41360,"human. This is why, even in religions very far removed from those we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have been studying, the worshippers, when assembled to ask their gods",Elementary Forms
41360,"for some event which they ardently desire, are forced to figure it. Of",Elementary Forms
41360,"course, the word is also a way of expressing it; but the gesture is no",Elementary Forms
41360,less natural; it bursts out from the organism just as spontaneously; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"even precedes the word, or, in any case, accompanies it.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But if we can thus understand how the gestures acquired a place in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony, we still must explain the efficacy attributed to them. If the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian repeats them regularly each new season, it is because he",Elementary Forms
41360,believes them essential to the success of the rite. Where could he have,Elementary Forms
41360,"gotten the idea that by imitating an animal, one causes it to reproduce?",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So manifest an error seems hardly intelligible so long as we see in the,Elementary Forms
41360,rite only the material end towards which it seems to aim. But we know,Elementary Forms
41360,that in addition to the effect which it is thought to have on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic species, it also exercises a profound influence over the souls",Elementary Forms
41360,of the worshippers who take part in it. They take away with them a,Elementary Forms
41360,"feeling of well-being, whose causes they cannot clearly see, but which",Elementary Forms
41360,"is well founded. They feel that the ceremony is good for them; and, as a",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter of fact, they reforge their moral nature in it. How could this",Elementary Forms
41360,sort of well-being fail to give them a feeling that the rite has,Elementary Forms
41360,"succeeded, that it has been what it set out to be, and that it has",Elementary Forms
41360,attained the ends at which it was aimed? As the only end which was,Elementary Forms
41360,"consciously sought was the reproduction of the totemic species, this",Elementary Forms
41360,"seems to be assured by the means employed, the efficacy of which is thus",Elementary Forms
41360,proven. Thus it comes about that men attribute creative virtues to their,Elementary Forms
41360,"gestures, which in themselves are vain. The moral efficacy of the rite,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is real, leads to the belief in its physical efficacy, which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"imaginary; that of the whole, to the belief in that of each part by",Elementary Forms
41360,itself. The truly useful effects produced by the whole ceremony are like,Elementary Forms
41360,an experimental justification of the elementary practices out of which,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is made, though in reality, all these practices are in no way",Elementary Forms
41360,"indispensable to its success. A certain proof, moreover, that they do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not act by themselves is that they may be replaced by others, of a very",Elementary Forms
41360,"different nature, without any modification of the final result. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"appears that there are Intichiuma which include only oblations, with no",Elementary Forms
41360,"imitative rites; others are purely imitative, and include no oblations.",Elementary Forms
41360,"However, both are believed to have the same efficacy. So if a price is",Elementary Forms
41360,"attached to these various man[oe]uvres, it is not because of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"intrinsic value, but because they are a part of a complex rite, whose",Elementary Forms
41360,utility as a whole is realized.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are able to understand this state of mind all the easier because we,Elementary Forms
41360,can still observe it about us. Especially among the most cultivated,Elementary Forms
41360,"peoples and environments, we frequently meet with believers who, though",Elementary Forms
41360,having doubts as to the special efficacy attributed by dogma to each,Elementary Forms
41360,"rite considered separately, still continue to participate in the cult.",Elementary Forms
41360,They are not sure that the details of the prescribed observances are,Elementary Forms
41360,rationally justifiable; but they feel that it would be impossible to,Elementary Forms
41360,free oneself of them without falling into a moral confusion before which,Elementary Forms
41360,they recoil. The very fact that in them the faith has lost its,Elementary Forms
41360,intellectual foundations throws into eminence the profound reasons upon,Elementary Forms
41360,which they rest. This is why the easy criticisms to which an unduly,Elementary Forms
41360,simple rationalism has sometimes submitted ritual prescriptions,Elementary Forms
41360,generally leave the believer indifferent: it is because the true,Elementary Forms
41360,justification of religious practices does not lie in the apparent ends,Elementary Forms
41360,"which they pursue, but rather in the invisible action which they",Elementary Forms
41360,exercise over the mind and in the way in which they affect our mental,Elementary Forms
41360,"status. Likewise, when preachers undertake to convince, they devote much",Elementary Forms
41360,less attention to establishing directly and by methodical proofs the,Elementary Forms
41360,truth of any particular proposition or the utility of such and such an,Elementary Forms
41360,"observance, than to awakening or reawakening the sentiment of the moral",Elementary Forms
41360,comfort attained by the regular celebration of the cult. Thus they,Elementary Forms
41360,"create a predisposition to belief, which precedes proofs, which leads",Elementary Forms
41360,"the mind to overlook the insufficiency of the logical reasons, and which",Elementary Forms
41360,thus prepares it for the proposition whose acceptance is desired. This,Elementary Forms
41360,"favourable prejudice, this impulse towards believing, is just what",Elementary Forms
41360,constitutes faith; and it is faith which makes the authority of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, according to the believer, whoever he may be, Christian or",Elementary Forms
41360,Australian. The only superiority of the former is that he better,Elementary Forms
41360,accounts for the psychological process from which his faith results; he,Elementary Forms
41360,"knows that ""it is faith that saves.""",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is because faith has this origin that it is, in a sense, ""impermeable",Elementary Forms
41360,"to experience.""[1183] If the intermittent failures of the Intichiuma do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not shake the confidence of the Australian in his rite, it is because",Elementary Forms
41360,he holds with all the strength of his soul to these practices in which,Elementary Forms
41360,he periodically recreates himself; he could not deny their principle,Elementary Forms
41360,"without causing an upheaval of his own being, which resists. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"howsoever great this force of resistance may be, it cannot radically",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinguish religious mentality from the other forms of human mentality,",Elementary Forms
41360,even those which are the most habitually opposed to it. In this,Elementary Forms
41360,"connection, that of a scholar differs from the preceding only in degree.",Elementary Forms
41360,When a scientific law has the authority of numerous and varied,Elementary Forms
41360,"experiments, it is against all method to renounce it too quickly upon",Elementary Forms
41360,the discovery of a fact which seems to contradict it. It is still,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to make sure that the fact does not allow of a single,Elementary Forms
41360,"interpretation, and that it is impossible to account for it, without",Elementary Forms
41360,abandoning the proposition which it seems to invalidate. Now the,Elementary Forms
41360,Australian does not proceed otherwise when he attributes the failure of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Intichiuma to some sorcery, or the abundance of a premature crop to",Elementary Forms
41360,a mystic Intichiuma celebrated in the beyond. He has all the more reason,Elementary Forms
41360,"for not doubting his rite on the belief in a contrary fact, since its",Elementary Forms
41360,"value is, or seems to be, established by a larger number of harmonizing",Elementary Forms
41360,"facts. In the first place, the moral efficacy of the ceremony is real",Elementary Forms
41360,and is felt directly by all who participate in it; there is a constantly,Elementary Forms
41360,"renewed experience in it, whose importance no contradictory experience",Elementary Forms
41360,"can diminish. Also, the physical efficacy itself is not unable to find",Elementary Forms
41360,an at least apparent confirmation in the data of objective observation.,Elementary Forms
41360,"As a matter of fact, the totemic species normally does reproduce",Elementary Forms
41360,"regularly; so in the great majority of cases, everything happens just as",Elementary Forms
41360,if the ritual gestures really did produce the effects expected of them.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Failures are the exception. As the rites, and especially those which are",Elementary Forms
41360,"periodical, demand nothing more of nature than that it follow its",Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinary course, it is not surprising that it should generally have the",Elementary Forms
41360,air of obeying them. So if the believer shows himself indocile to,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain lessons of experience, he does so because of other experiences",Elementary Forms
41360,which seem more demonstrative. The scholar does not do otherwise; only,Elementary Forms
41360,he introduces more method.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So magic is not, as Frazer has held,[1184] an original fact, of which",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is only a derived form. Quite on the contrary, it was under the",Elementary Forms
41360,influence of religious ideas that the precepts upon which the art of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"magician is based were established, and it was only through a secondary",Elementary Forms
41360,extension that they were applied to purely lay relations. Since all the,Elementary Forms
41360,forces of the universe have been conceived on the model of the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces, the contagiousness inherent in the second was extended to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first, and men have believed that all the properties of a body could be",Elementary Forms
41360,"transmitted contagiously. Likewise, when the principle according to",Elementary Forms
41360,"which like produces like had been established, in order to satisfy",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain religious needs, it detached itself from its ritual origins to",Elementary Forms
41360,"become, through a sort of spontaneous generalization, a law of",Elementary Forms
41360,nature.[1185] But in order to understand these fundamental axioms of,Elementary Forms
41360,"magic, they must be replaced in the religious atmosphere in which they",Elementary Forms
41360,arose and which alone enables us to account for them. When we regard,Elementary Forms
41360,"them as the work of isolated individuals or solitary magicians, we ask",Elementary Forms
41360,"how they could ever have occurred to the mind of man, for nothing in",Elementary Forms
41360,experience could either suggest or verify them; and especially we do not,Elementary Forms
41360,explain how so deceiving an art has been able to impose itself for so,Elementary Forms
41360,long a time in the confidence of men. But this problem disappears when,Elementary Forms
41360,we realize that the faith inspired by magic is only a particular case of,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious faith in general, and that it is itself the product, at least",Elementary Forms
41360,"indirectly, of a collective effervescence. This is as much as to say",Elementary Forms
41360,that the use of the expression sympathetic magic to designate the system,Elementary Forms
41360,of rites which we have just been speaking is not very exact. There are,Elementary Forms
41360,"sympathetic rites, but they are not peculiar to magic; not only are they",Elementary Forms
41360,"to be found in religion, but it was from religion that magic received",Elementary Forms
41360,"them. So we only risk confusion when, by the name we give them, we have",Elementary Forms
41360,the air of making them something which is specifically magic.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The results of our analysis thus attach themselves to and confirm those,Elementary Forms
41360,attained by MM. Hubert and Mauss when they studied magic directly.[1186],Elementary Forms
41360,They have shown that this is nothing more nor less than crude industry,Elementary Forms
41360,"based on incomplete science. Behind the mechanisms, purely laical in",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearance, which are used by the magician, they point out a background",Elementary Forms
41360,"of religious conceptions and a whole world of forces, the idea of which",Elementary Forms
41360,has been taken by magic from religion. We are now able to understand how,Elementary Forms
41360,it comes that magic is so full of religious elements: it is because it,Elementary Forms
41360,was born of religion.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the principle which has just been set forth does not merely have a,Elementary Forms
41360,function in the ritual; it is of direct interest for the theory of,Elementary Forms
41360,"knowledge. In fact, it is a concrete statement of the law of causality",Elementary Forms
41360,"and, in all probability, one of the most primitive statements of it",Elementary Forms
41360,which has ever existed. A full conception of the causal relation is,Elementary Forms
41360,implied in the power thus attributed to the like to produce the like;,Elementary Forms
41360,"and this conception dominates primitive thought, for it is the basis",Elementary Forms
41360,both of the practices of the cult and the technique of the magician. So,Elementary Forms
41360,the origins of the precept upon which the imitative rites depend are,Elementary Forms
41360,able to clarify those of the principle of causality. The genesis of one,Elementary Forms
41360,should aid us in understanding the genesis of the other. Now we have,Elementary Forms
41360,shown how the former is a product of social causes: it was elaborated by,Elementary Forms
41360,"groups having collective ends in view, and it translates collective",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments. So we may assume that the same is true for the second.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, an analysis of the principle of causality is sufficient to",Elementary Forms
41360,assure us that the diverse elements of which it is composed really did,Elementary Forms
41360,have this origin.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The first thing which is implied in the notion of the causal relation is,Elementary Forms
41360,"the idea of efficacy, of productive power, of active force. By cause we",Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily mean something capable of producing a certain change. The,Elementary Forms
41360,cause is the force before it has shown the power which is in it; the,Elementary Forms
41360,"effect is this same power, only actualized. Men have always thought of",Elementary Forms
41360,causality in dynamic terms. Of course certain philosophers had refused,Elementary Forms
41360,all objective value to this conception; they see in it only an arbitrary,Elementary Forms
41360,"construction of the imagination, which corresponds to nothing in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"things themselves. But, at present, we have no need of asking whether it",Elementary Forms
41360,is founded in reality or not; it is enough for us to state that it,Elementary Forms
41360,exists and that it constitutes and always has constituted an element of,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinary mentality; and this is recognized even by those who criticize,Elementary Forms
41360,"it. Our immediate purpose is to seek, not what it may be worth",Elementary Forms
41360,"logically, but how it is to be explained.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now it depends upon social causes. Our analysis of facts has already,Elementary Forms
41360,"enabled us to see that the prototype of the idea of force was the mana,",Elementary Forms
41360,"wakan, orenda, the totemic principle or any of the various names given",Elementary Forms
41360,to collective force objectified and projected into things.[1187] The,Elementary Forms
41360,first power which men have thought of as such seems to have been that,Elementary Forms
41360,exercised by humanity over its members. Thus reason confirms the results,Elementary Forms
41360,"of observation; in fact, it is even possible to show why this notion of",Elementary Forms
41360,"power, efficacy or active force could not have come from any other",Elementary Forms
41360,source.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the first place, it is evident and recognized by all that it could",Elementary Forms
41360,not be furnished to us by external experience. Our senses only enable,Elementary Forms
41360,"us to perceive phenomena which coexist or which follow one another, but",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing perceived by them could give us the idea of this determining and,Elementary Forms
41360,compelling action which is characteristic of what we call a power or,Elementary Forms
41360,"force. They can touch only realized and known conditions, each separate",Elementary Forms
41360,from the others; the internal process uniting these conditions escapes,Elementary Forms
41360,them. Nothing that we learn could possibly suggest to us the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,what an influence or efficaciousness is. It is for this very reason that,Elementary Forms
41360,the philosophers of empiricism have regarded these different conceptions,Elementary Forms
41360,as so many mythological aberrations. But even supposing that they all,Elementary Forms
41360,"are hallucinations, it is still necessary to show how they originated.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If external experience counts for nothing in the origin of these ideas,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and it is equally inadmissible that they were given us ready-made, one",Elementary Forms
41360,"might suppose that they come from internal experience. In fact, the",Elementary Forms
41360,notion of force obviously includes many spiritual elements which could,Elementary Forms
41360,only have been taken from our psychic life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Some have believed that the act by which our will brings a deliberation,Elementary Forms
41360,"to a close, restrains our impulses and commands our organism, might have",Elementary Forms
41360,"served as the model of this construction. In willing, it is said, we",Elementary Forms
41360,perceive ourselves directly as a power in action. So when this idea had,Elementary Forms
41360,"once occurred to men, it seems that they only had to extend it to things",Elementary Forms
41360,to establish the conception of force.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As long as the animist theory passed as a demonstrated truth, this",Elementary Forms
41360,explanation was able to appear to be confirmed by history. If the forces,Elementary Forms
41360,with which human thought primitively populated the world really had been,Elementary Forms
41360,"spirits, that is to say, personal and conscious beings more or less",Elementary Forms
41360,"similar to men, it was actually possible to believe that our individual",Elementary Forms
41360,experience was enough to furnish us with the constituent elements of the,Elementary Forms
41360,notion of force. But we know that the first forces which men imagined,Elementary Forms
41360,"were, on the contrary, anonymous, vague and diffused powers which",Elementary Forms
41360,"resemble cosmic forces in their impersonality, and which are therefore",Elementary Forms
41360,"most sharply contrasted with the eminently personal power, the human",Elementary Forms
41360,will. So it is impossible that they should have been conceived in its,Elementary Forms
41360,image.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, there is one essential characteristic of the impersonal forces",Elementary Forms
41360,which would be inexplicable under this hypothesis: this is their,Elementary Forms
41360,communicability. The forces of nature have always been thought of as,Elementary Forms
41360,"capable of passing from one object to another, of mixing, combining and",Elementary Forms
41360,transforming themselves into one another. It is even this property which,Elementary Forms
41360,"gives them their value as an explanation, for it is through this that",Elementary Forms
41360,effects can be connected with their causes without a break of,Elementary Forms
41360,continuity. Now the self has just the opposite characteristic: it is,Elementary Forms
41360,incommunicable. It cannot change its material substratum or spread from,Elementary Forms
41360,one to another; it spreads out in metaphor only. So the way in which it,Elementary Forms
41360,decides and executes its decisions could never have suggested the idea,Elementary Forms
41360,of an energy which communicates itself and which can even confound,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself with others and, through these combinations and mixings, give",Elementary Forms
41360,rise to new effects.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Therefore, the idea of force, as implied in the conception of the causal",Elementary Forms
41360,"relation, must present a double character. In the first place, it can",Elementary Forms
41360,come only from our internal experience; the only forces which we can,Elementary Forms
41360,"directly learn about are necessarily moral forces. But, at the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"time, they must be impersonal, for the notion of an impersonal power was",Elementary Forms
41360,the first to be constituted. Now the only ones which satisfy these two,Elementary Forms
41360,conditions are those coming from life together: they are collective,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces. In fact, these are, on the one hand, entirely psychical; they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are made up exclusively of objectified ideas and sentiments. But, on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, they are impersonal by definition, for they are the product",Elementary Forms
41360,"of a co-operation. Being the work of all, they are not the possession of",Elementary Forms
41360,anybody in particular. They are so slightly attached to the,Elementary Forms
41360,personalities of the subjects in whom they reside that they are never,Elementary Forms
41360,"fixed there. Just as they enter them from without, they are also always",Elementary Forms
41360,"ready to leave them. Of themselves, they tend to spread further and",Elementary Forms
41360,further and to invade ever new domains: we know that there are none more,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagious, and consequently more communicable. Of course physical",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces have the same property, but we cannot know this directly; we",Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot even become acquainted with them as such, for they are outside",Elementary Forms
41360,"us. When I throw myself against an obstacle, I have a sensation of",Elementary Forms
41360,hindrance and trouble; but the force causing this sensation is not in,Elementary Forms
41360,"me, but in the obstacle, and is consequently outside the circle of my",Elementary Forms
41360,"perception. We perceive its effects, but we cannot reach the cause",Elementary Forms
41360,itself. It is otherwise with social forces: they are a part of our,Elementary Forms
41360,"internal life, as we know, more than the products of their action; we",Elementary Forms
41360,see them acting. The force isolating the sacred being and holding,Elementary Forms
41360,profane beings at a distance is not really in this being; it lives in,Elementary Forms
41360,the minds of the believers. So they perceive it at the very moment when,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is acting upon their wills, to inhibit certain movements or command",Elementary Forms
41360,"others. In a word, this constraining and necessitating action, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"escapes us when coming from an external object, is readily perceptible",Elementary Forms
41360,here because everything is inside us. Of course we do not always,Elementary Forms
41360,"interpret it in an adequate manner, but at least we cannot fail to be",Elementary Forms
41360,conscious of it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the idea of force bears the mark of its origin in an apparent",Elementary Forms
41360,"way. In fact, it implies the idea of power which, in its turn, does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"come without those of ascendancy, mastership and domination, and their",Elementary Forms
41360,"corollaries, dependence and subordination; now the relations expressed",Elementary Forms
41360,by all these ideas are eminently social. It is society which classifies,Elementary Forms
41360,"beings into superiors and inferiors, into commanding masters and obeying",Elementary Forms
41360,servants; it is society which confers upon the former the singular,Elementary Forms
41360,property which makes the command efficacious and which makes _power_. So,Elementary Forms
41360,everything tends to prove that the first powers of which the human mind,Elementary Forms
41360,had any idea were those which societies have established in organizing,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves: it is in their image that the powers of the physical world,Elementary Forms
41360,"have been conceived. Also, men have never succeeded in imagining",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves as forces mistress over the bodies in which they reside,",Elementary Forms
41360,"except by introducing concepts taken from social life. In fact, these",Elementary Forms
41360,must be distinguished from their physical doubles and must be attributed,Elementary Forms
41360,"a dignity superior to that of these latter; in a word, they must think",Elementary Forms
41360,"of themselves as souls. As a matter of fact, men have always given the",Elementary Forms
41360,form of souls to the forces which they believe that they are. But we,Elementary Forms
41360,know that the soul is quite another thing from a name given to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"abstract faculty of moving, thinking and feeling; before all, it is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious principle, a particular aspect of the collective force. In",Elementary Forms
41360,"fine, a man feels that he has a soul, and consequently a force, because",Elementary Forms
41360,"he is a social being. Though an animal moves its members just as we do,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and though it has the same power as we over its muscles, nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,authorizes us to suppose that it is conscious of itself as an active and,Elementary Forms
41360,"efficacious cause. This is because it does not have, or, to speak more",Elementary Forms
41360,"exactly, does not attribute to itself a soul. But if it does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"attribute a soul to itself, it is because it does not participate in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"social life comparable to that of men. Among animals, there is nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,resembling a civilization.[1188],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But the notion of force is not all of the principle of causality. This,Elementary Forms
41360,consists in a judgment stating that every force develops in a definite,Elementary Forms
41360,"manner, and that the state in which it is at each particular moment of",Elementary Forms
41360,"its existence predetermines the next state. The former is called cause,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the latter, effect, and the causal judgment affirms the existence of a",Elementary Forms
41360,necessary connection between these two moments for every force. The mind,Elementary Forms
41360,"posits this connection before having any proofs of it, under the empire",Elementary Forms
41360,of a sort of constraint from which it cannot free itself; it postulates,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, as they say, _a priori_.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Empiricism has never succeeded in accounting for this apriorism and,Elementary Forms
41360,necessity. Philosophers of this school have never been able to explain,Elementary Forms
41360,"how an association of ideas, reinforced by habit, could produce more",Elementary Forms
41360,than an expectation or a stronger or weaker predisposition on the part,Elementary Forms
41360,of ideas to appear in a determined order. But the principle of causality,Elementary Forms
41360,has quite another character. It is not merely an imminent tendency of,Elementary Forms
41360,"our thought to take certain forms; it is an external norm, superior to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the flow of our representations, which it dominates and rules",Elementary Forms
41360,imperatively. It is invested with an authority which binds the mind and,Elementary Forms
41360,"surpasses it, which is as much as to say that the mind is not its",Elementary Forms
41360,"artisan. In this connection, it is useless to substitute hereditary",Elementary Forms
41360,"habit for individual habit, for habit does not change its nature by",Elementary Forms
41360,lasting longer than one man's life; it is merely stronger. An instinct,Elementary Forms
41360,is not a rule.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The rites which we have been studying allow us to catch a glimpse of,Elementary Forms
41360,"another source of this authority, which, up to the present, has scarcely",Elementary Forms
41360,"been suspected. Let us bear in mind how the law of causality, which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"imitative rites put into practice, was born. Being filled with one",Elementary Forms
41360,"single preoccupation, the group assembles: if the species whose name it",Elementary Forms
41360,"bears does not reproduce, it is a matter of concern to the whole clan.",Elementary Forms
41360,The common sentiment thus animating all the members is outwardly,Elementary Forms
41360,"expressed by certain gestures, which are always the same in the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances, and after the ceremony has been performed, it happens,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the reasons set forth, that the desired result seems obtained. So an",Elementary Forms
41360,association arises between the idea of this result and that of the,Elementary Forms
41360,gestures preceding it; and this association does not vary from one,Elementary Forms
41360,subject to another; it is the same for all the participators in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rite, since it is the product of a collective experience. However, if no",Elementary Forms
41360,"other factor intervened, it would produce only a collective expectation;",Elementary Forms
41360,"after the imitative gestures had been accomplished, everybody would",Elementary Forms
41360,"await the subsequent appearance of the desired event, with more or less",Elementary Forms
41360,confidence; an imperative rule of thought could never be established by,Elementary Forms
41360,this. But since a social interest of the greatest importance is at,Elementary Forms
41360,"stake, society cannot allow things to follow their own course at the",Elementary Forms
41360,whim of circumstances; it intervenes actively in such a way as to,Elementary Forms
41360,regulate their march in conformity with its needs. So it demands that,Elementary Forms
41360,"this ceremony, which it cannot do without, be repeated every time that",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is necessary, and consequently, that the movements, a condition of",Elementary Forms
41360,"its success, be executed regularly: it imposes them as an obligation.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Now they imply a certain definite state of mind which, in return,",Elementary Forms
41360,participates in this same obligatory character. To prescribe that one,Elementary Forms
41360,"must imitate an animal or plant to make them reproduce, is equivalent to",Elementary Forms
41360,"stating it as an axiom which is above all doubt, that like produces",Elementary Forms
41360,like. Opinion cannot allow men to deny this principle in theory without,Elementary Forms
41360,also allowing them to violate it in their conduct. So society imposes,Elementary Forms
41360,"it, along with the practices which are derived from it, and thus the",Elementary Forms
41360,ritual precept is doubled by a logical precept which is only the,Elementary Forms
41360,intellectual aspect of the former. The authority of each is derived from,Elementary Forms
41360,the same source: society. The respect which this inspires is,Elementary Forms
41360,"communicated to the ways of thought to which it attaches a value, just",Elementary Forms
41360,as much as to ways of action. So a man cannot set aside either the ones,Elementary Forms
41360,or the others without hurling himself against public opinion. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,why the former require the adherence of the intelligence before,Elementary Forms
41360,"examination, just as the latter require the submission of the will.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"From this example, we can show once more how the sociological theory of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the idea of causality, and of the categories in general, sets aside the",Elementary Forms
41360,"classical doctrines on the question, while conciliating them. Together",Elementary Forms
41360,"with apriorism, it maintains the prejudicial and necessary character of",Elementary Forms
41360,the causal relation; but it does not limit itself to affirming this; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"accounts for it, yet without making it vanish under the pretext of",Elementary Forms
41360,"explaining it, as empiricism does. On the other hand, there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,question of denying the part due to individual experience. There can be,Elementary Forms
41360,"no doubt that by himself, the individual observes the regular succession",Elementary Forms
41360,of phenomena and thus acquires a certain _feeling_ of regularity. But,Elementary Forms
41360,this feeling is not the _category_ of causality. The former is,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual, subjective, incommunicable; we make it ourselves, out of our",Elementary Forms
41360,"own personal observations. The second is the work of the group, and is",Elementary Forms
41360,given to us ready-made. It is a frame-work in which our empirical,Elementary Forms
41360,"ascertainments arrange themselves and which enables us to think of them,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that is to say, to see them from a point of view which makes it possible",Elementary Forms
41360,"for us to understand one another in regard to them. Of course, if this",Elementary Forms
41360,"frame can be applied to the contents, that shows that it is not out of",Elementary Forms
41360,relation with the matter which it contains; but it is not to be confused,Elementary Forms
41360,with this. It surpasses it and dominates it. This is because it is of a,Elementary Forms
41360,different origin. It is not a mere summary of individual experiences;,Elementary Forms
41360,"before all else, it is made to fulfil the exigencies of life in common.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fine, the error of empiricism has been to regard the causal bond as",Elementary Forms
41360,merely an intellectual construction of speculative thought and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"product of a more or less methodical generalization. Now, by itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"pure speculation can give birth only to provisional, hypothetical and",Elementary Forms
41360,"more or less plausible views, but ones which must always be regarded",Elementary Forms
41360,"with suspicion, for we can never be sure that some new observation in",Elementary Forms
41360,the future will not invalidate them. An axiom which the mind accepts and,Elementary Forms
41360,"must accept, without control and without reservation, could never come",Elementary Forms
41360,"from this source. Only the necessities of action, and especially of",Elementary Forms
41360,"collective action, can and must express themselves in categorical",Elementary Forms
41360,"formulae, which are peremptory and short, and admit of no contradiction,",Elementary Forms
41360,for collective movements are possible only on condition of being in,Elementary Forms
41360,"concert and, therefore, regulated and definite. They do not allow of any",Elementary Forms
41360,"fumbling, the source of anarchy; by themselves, they tend towards an",Elementary Forms
41360,"organization which, when once established, imposes itself upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"individuals. And as action cannot go beyond intelligence, it frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,happens that the latter is drawn into the same way and accepts without,Elementary Forms
41360,discussion the theoretical postulates demanded by action. The,Elementary Forms
41360,imperatives of thought are probably only another side of the imperatives,Elementary Forms
41360,of action.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that we have never dreamed of",Elementary Forms
41360,offering the preceding observations as a complete theory of the concept,Elementary Forms
41360,of causality. The question is too complex to be resolved thus. The,Elementary Forms
41360,principle of causality has been understood differently in different,Elementary Forms
41360,"times and places; in a single society, it varies with the social",Elementary Forms
41360,environment and the kingdoms of nature to which it is applied.[1189] So,Elementary Forms
41360,it would be impossible to determine with sufficient precision the causes,Elementary Forms
41360,"and conditions upon which it depends, after a consideration of only one",Elementary Forms
41360,of the forms which it has presented during the course of history. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"views which we have set forth should be regarded as mere indications,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which must be controlled and completed. However, as the causal law which",Elementary Forms
41360,we have been considering is certainly one of the most primitive which,Elementary Forms
41360,"exists, and as it has played a considerable part in the development of",Elementary Forms
41360,"human thought and industry, it is a privileged experiment, so we may",Elementary Forms
41360,presume that the remarks of which it has been the occasion may be,Elementary Forms
41360,generalized to a certain degree.,Elementary Forms

41360,III.--_Representative or Commemorative Rites_,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The explanation which we have given of the positive rites of which we,Elementary Forms
41360,have been speaking in the two preceding chapters attributes to them a,Elementary Forms
41360,"significance which is, above all, moral and social. The physical",Elementary Forms
41360,efficaciousness assigned to them by the believer is the product of an,Elementary Forms
41360,interpretation which conceals the essential reason for their existence:,Elementary Forms
41360,it is because they serve to remake individuals and groups morally that,Elementary Forms
41360,they are believed to have a power over things. But even if this,Elementary Forms
41360,"hypothesis has enabled us to account for the facts, we cannot say that",Elementary Forms
41360,"it has been demonstrated directly; at first view, it even seems to",Elementary Forms
41360,conciliate itself rather badly with the nature of the ritual mechanisms,Elementary Forms
41360,which we have analysed. Whether they consist in oblations or imitative,Elementary Forms
41360,"acts, the gestures composing them have purely material ends in view;",Elementary Forms
41360,"they have, or seem to have, the sole object of making the totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,"species reproduce. Under these circumstances, is it not surprising that",Elementary Forms
41360,their real function should be to serve moral ends?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is true that their physical function may have been exaggerated by,Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen, even in the cases where it is the most",Elementary Forms
41360,"incontestable. According to these authors, each clan celebrates its",Elementary Forms
41360,"Intichiuma for the purpose of assuring a useful food to the other clans,",Elementary Forms
41360,and the whole cult consists in a sort of economic co-operation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,different totemic groups; each works for the others. But according to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow, this conception of Australian totemism is wholly foreign to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the native mind. ""If,"" he says, ""the members of one totemic group set",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves to multiplying the animals or plants of the consecrated,Elementary Forms
41360,"species, and seem to work for their companions of other totems, we must",Elementary Forms
41360,be careful not to regard this collaboration as the fundamental principle,Elementary Forms
41360,of Arunta or Loritja totemism. The blacks themselves have never told me,Elementary Forms
41360,"that this was the object of their ceremonies. Of course, when I",Elementary Forms
41360,"suggested and explained the idea to them, they understood it and",Elementary Forms
41360,acquiesced. But I should not be blamed for having some distrust of,Elementary Forms
41360,"replies gained in this fashion."" Strehlow also remarks that this way of",Elementary Forms
41360,interpreting the rite is contradicted by the fact that the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,animals and plants are not all edible or useful; some are good for,Elementary Forms
41360,nothing; some are even dangerous. So the ceremonies which concern them,Elementary Forms
41360,"could not have any such end in view.[1190] ""When some one asks the",Elementary Forms
41360,"natives what the determining reason for these ceremonies is,"" concludes",Elementary Forms
41360,"our author, ""they are unanimous in replying: 'It is because our",Elementary Forms
41360,ancestors arranged things thus. This is why we do thus and not,Elementary Forms
41360,"differently.'""[1191] But in saying that the rite is observed because it",Elementary Forms
41360,"comes from the ancestors, it is admitted that its authority is",Elementary Forms
41360,"confounded with the authority of tradition, which is a social affair of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the first order. Men celebrate it to remain faithful to the past, to",Elementary Forms
41360,"keep for the group its normal physiognomy, and not because of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"physical effects which it may produce. Thus, the way in which the",Elementary Forms
41360,believers themselves explain them show the profound reasons upon which,Elementary Forms
41360,the rites proceed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there are cases when this aspect of the ceremonies is immediately,Elementary Forms
41360,apparent.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These may be observed the best among the Warramunga.[1192],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among this people, each clan is thought to be descended from a single",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancestor who, after having been born in some determined spot, passed his",Elementary Forms
41360,terrestrial existence in travelling over the country in every direction.,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is he who, in the course of his voyages, gave to the land the form",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it now has; it is he who made the mountains and plains, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"water-holes and streams, etc. At the same time, he sowed upon his route",Elementary Forms
41360,"living germs which were disengaged from his body and, after many",Elementary Forms
41360,"successive reincarnations, became the actual members of the clan. Now",Elementary Forms
41360,the ceremony of the Warramunga which corresponds exactly to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Intichiuma of the Arunta, has the object of commemorating and",Elementary Forms
41360,representing the mythical history of this ancestor. There is no,Elementary Forms
41360,"question of oblations or, except in one single case,[1193] of imitative",Elementary Forms
41360,"practices. The rite consists solely in recollecting the past and, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"way, making it present by means of a veritable dramatic representation.",Elementary Forms
41360,"This word is the more exact because in this ceremony, the officiant is",Elementary Forms
41360,"in no way considered an incarnation of the ancestor, whom he represents;",Elementary Forms
41360,he is an actor playing a role.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As an example, let us describe the Intichiuma of the Black Snake, as",Elementary Forms
41360,Spencer and Gillen observed it.[1194],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,An initial ceremony does not seem to refer to the past; at least the,Elementary Forms
41360,description of it which is given us gives no authorization for,Elementary Forms
41360,interpreting it in this sense. It consists in running and leaping on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"part of two officiants,[1195] who are decorated with designs",Elementary Forms
41360,representing the black snake. When they finally fall exhausted on the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ground, the assistants gently pass their hands over the emblematic",Elementary Forms
41360,designs with which the backs of the two actors are covered. They say,Elementary Forms
41360,that this act pleases the black snake. It is only afterwards that the,Elementary Forms
41360,series of commemorative ceremonies commences.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"They put into action the mythical history of the ancestor Thalaualla,",Elementary Forms
41360,from the moment he emerged from the ground up to his definite return,Elementary Forms
41360,thither. They follow him through all his voyages. The myth says that in,Elementary Forms
41360,"each of the localities where he sojourned, he celebrated totemic",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies; they now repeat them in the same order in which they are,Elementary Forms
41360,supposed to have taken place originally. The movement which is acted the,Elementary Forms
41360,most frequently consists in twisting the entire body about rhythmically,Elementary Forms
41360,and violently; this is because the ancestor did the same thing to make,Elementary Forms
41360,the germs of life which were in him come out. The actors have their,Elementary Forms
41360,"bodies covered with down, which is detached and flies away during these",Elementary Forms
41360,movements; this is a way of representing the flight of these mystic,Elementary Forms
41360,germs and their dispersion into space.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It will be remembered that among the Arunta, the scene of the ceremony",Elementary Forms
41360,"is determined by the ritual: it is the spot where the sacred rocks,",Elementary Forms
41360,"trees and water-holes are found, and the worshippers must go there to",Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrate the cult. Among the Warramunga, on the contrary, the",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonial ground is arbitrarily chosen according to convenience. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"a conventional scene. However, the original scene of the events whose",Elementary Forms
41360,reproduction constitutes the theme of the rite is itself represented by,Elementary Forms
41360,means of designs. Sometimes these designs are made upon the very bodies,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the actors. For example, a small circle coloured red, painted on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"back and stomach, represents a water-hole.[1196] In other cases, the",Elementary Forms
41360,image is traced on the soil. Upon a ground previously soaked and covered,Elementary Forms
41360,"with red ochre, they draw curved lines, made up of a series of white",Elementary Forms
41360,"points, which symbolize a stream or a mountain. This is a beginning of",Elementary Forms
41360,decoration.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In addition to the properly religious ceremonies which the ancestor is,Elementary Forms
41360,"believed to have celebrated long ago, they also represent simple",Elementary Forms
41360,"episodes of his career, either epic or comic. Thus, at a given moment,",Elementary Forms
41360,"while three actors are on the scene, occupied in an important rite,",Elementary Forms
41360,another one hides behind a bunch of trees situated at some distance. A,Elementary Forms
41360,packet of down is attached about his neck which represents a _wallaby_.,Elementary Forms
41360,"As soon as the principal ceremony is finished, an old man traces a line",Elementary Forms
41360,upon the ground which is directed towards the spot where the fourth,Elementary Forms
41360,"actor is hidden. The others march behind him, with eyes lowered and",Elementary Forms
41360,"fixed upon this line, as though following a trail. When they discover",Elementary Forms
41360,"the man, they assume a stupefied air and one of them beats him with a",Elementary Forms
41360,club. This represents an incident in the life of the great black snake.,Elementary Forms
41360,"One day, his son went hunting, caught a _wallaby_ and ate it without",Elementary Forms
41360,"giving his father any. The latter followed his tracks, surprised him and",Elementary Forms
41360,forced him to disgorge; it is to this that the beating at the end of the,Elementary Forms
41360,representation alludes.[1197],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We shall not relate here all the mythical events which are represented,Elementary Forms
41360,successively. The preceding examples are sufficient to show the,Elementary Forms
41360,"character of these ceremonies: they are dramas, but of a particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"variety; they act, or at least they are believed to act, upon the course",Elementary Forms
41360,"of nature. When the commemoration of Thalaualla is terminated, the",Elementary Forms
41360,Warramunga are convinced that black snakes cannot fail to increase and,Elementary Forms
41360,"multiply. So these dramas are rites, and even rites which, by the nature",Elementary Forms
41360,"of their efficacy, are comparable on every point to those which",Elementary Forms
41360,constitute the Intichiuma of the Arunta.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore each is able to clarify the other. It is even more legitimate,Elementary Forms
41360,to compare them than if there were no break of continuity between them.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Not only is the end pursued identical in each case, but the most",Elementary Forms
41360,characteristic part of the Warramunga ritual is found in germ in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other. In fact, the Intichiuma, as the Arunta generally perform it,",Elementary Forms
41360,contains within it a sort of implicit commemoration. The places where it,Elementary Forms
41360,is celebrated are necessarily those which the ancestor made illustrious.,Elementary Forms
41360,The roads over which the worshippers pass in the course of their pious,Elementary Forms
41360,pilgrimages are those which the heroes of the Alcheringa traversed; the,Elementary Forms
41360,places where they stop to proceed with the rites are those where their,Elementary Forms
41360,"fathers sojourned themselves, where they vanished into the ground, etc.",Elementary Forms
41360,So everything brings their memory to the minds of the assistants.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, to the manual rites they frequently add hymns relating the",Elementary Forms
41360,"exploits of their ancestors.[1198] If, instead of being told, these",Elementary Forms
41360,"stories are acted, and if, in this new form, they develop in such a way",Elementary Forms
41360,"as to become an essential part of the ceremony, then we have the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony of the Warramunga. But even more can be said, for on one side,",Elementary Forms
41360,the Arunta Intichiuma is already a sort of representation. The officiant,Elementary Forms
41360,is one with the ancestor from whom he is descended and whom he,Elementary Forms
41360,reincarnates.[1199] The gestures he makes are those which this ancestor,Elementary Forms
41360,"made in the same circumstances. Speaking exactly, of course he does not",Elementary Forms
41360,play the part of the ancestral personage as an actor might do it; he is,Elementary Forms
41360,"this personage himself. But it is true, notwithstanding, that, in one",Elementary Forms
41360,"sense, it is the hero who occupies the scene. In order to accentuate the",Elementary Forms
41360,"representative character of the rite, it would be sufficient for the",Elementary Forms
41360,duality of the ancestor and the officiant to become more marked; this is,Elementary Forms
41360,"just what happens among the Warramunga.[1200] Even among the Arunta, at",Elementary Forms
41360,least one Intichiuma is mentioned in which certain persons are charged,Elementary Forms
41360,with representing ancestors with whom they have no relationship of,Elementary Forms
41360,"mythical descent, and in which there is consequently a proper dramatic",Elementary Forms
41360,representation: this is the Intichiuma of the Emu.[1201] It seems that,Elementary Forms
41360,"in this case, also, contrarily to the general rule among this people,",Elementary Forms
41360,the theatre of the ceremony is artificially arranged.[1202],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It does not follow from the fact that, in spite of the differences",Elementary Forms
41360,"separating them, these two varieties of ceremony thus have an air of",Elementary Forms
41360,"kinship, as it were, that there is a definite relation of succession",Elementary Forms
41360,"between them, and that one is a transformation of the other. It may very",Elementary Forms
41360,well be that the resemblances pointed out come from the fact that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"two sprang from the same source, that is, from the same original",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony, of which they are only divergent forms: we shall even see that",Elementary Forms
41360,this hypothesis is the most probable one. But even without taking sides,Elementary Forms
41360,"on this question, what has already been said is enough to show that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"are rites of the same nature. So we may be allowed to compare them, and",Elementary Forms
41360,to use the one to enable us to understand the other better.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now the peculiar thing in the ceremonies of the Warramunga of which we,Elementary Forms
41360,"have been speaking, is that not a gesture is made whose object is to aid",Elementary Forms
41360,or to provoke directly the increase of the totemic species.[1203] If we,Elementary Forms
41360,"analyse the movements made, as well as the words spoken, we generally",Elementary Forms
41360,find nothing which betrays any intention of this sort. Everything is in,Elementary Forms
41360,representations whose only object can be to render the mythical past of,Elementary Forms
41360,the clan present to the mind. But the mythology of a group is the system,Elementary Forms
41360,of beliefs common to this group. The traditions whose memory it,Elementary Forms
41360,perpetuates express the way in which society represents man and the,Elementary Forms
41360,world; it is a moral system and a cosmology as well as a history. So the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rite serves and can serve only to sustain the vitality of these beliefs,",Elementary Forms
41360,"to keep them from being effaced from memory and, in sum, to revivify the",Elementary Forms
41360,"most essential elements of the collective consciousness. Through it, the",Elementary Forms
41360,group periodically renews the sentiment which it has of itself and of,Elementary Forms
41360,"its unity; at the same time, individuals are strengthened in their",Elementary Forms
41360,social natures. The glorious souvenirs which are made to live again,Elementary Forms
41360,"before their eyes, and with which they feel that they have a kinship,",Elementary Forms
41360,give them a feeling of strength and confidence: a man is surer of his,Elementary Forms
41360,faith when he sees to how distant a past it goes back and what great,Elementary Forms
41360,things it has inspired. This is the characteristic of the ceremony which,Elementary Forms
41360,makes it instructive. Its tendency is to act entirely upon the mind and,Elementary Forms
41360,upon it alone. So if men believe nevertheless that it acts upon things,Elementary Forms
41360,"and that it assures the prosperity of the species, this can be only as a",Elementary Forms
41360,reaction to the moral action which it exercises and which is obviously,Elementary Forms
41360,the only one which is real. Thus the hypothesis which we have proposed,Elementary Forms
41360,"is verified by a significant experiment, and this verification is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"more convincing because, as we have shown, there is no difference in",Elementary Forms
41360,nature between the ritual system of the Warramunga and that of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Arunta. The one only makes more evident what we had already conjectured,Elementary Forms
41360,from the other.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there are ceremonies in which this representative and idealistic,Elementary Forms
41360,character is still more accentuated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In those of which we have been speaking, the dramatic representation did",Elementary Forms
41360,not exist for itself; it was only a means having a very material end in,Elementary Forms
41360,"view, namely, the reproduction of the totemic species. But there are",Elementary Forms
41360,"others which do not differ materially from the preceding ones, but from",Elementary Forms
41360,"which, nevertheless, all preoccupations of this sort are absent. The",Elementary Forms
41360,past is here represented for the mere sake of representing it and fixing,Elementary Forms
41360,"it more firmly in the mind, while no determined action over nature is",Elementary Forms
41360,"expected of the rite. At least, the physical effects sometimes imputed",Elementary Forms
41360,to it are wholly secondary and have no relation with the liturgical,Elementary Forms
41360,importance attributed to it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is the case notably with the ceremonies which the Warramunga,Elementary Forms
41360,celebrate in honour of the snake Wollunqua.[1204],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"As we have already said, the Wollunqua is a totem of a very especial",Elementary Forms
41360,"sort. It is not an animal or vegetable species, but a unique being:",Elementary Forms
41360,"there is only one Wollunqua. Moreover, this being is purely mythical.",Elementary Forms
41360,The natives represent it as a colossal snake whose length is such that,Elementary Forms
41360,"when it rises on its tail its head is lost in the clouds. It resides,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they believe, in a water-hole called Thapauerlu, which is hidden in the",Elementary Forms
41360,bottom of a solitary valley. But if it differs in certain ways from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinary totems, it has all their distinctive characteristics",Elementary Forms
41360,nevertheless. It serves as the collective name and emblem of a whole,Elementary Forms
41360,"group of individuals who regard it as their common ancestor, while the",Elementary Forms
41360,relations which they sustain with this mythical beast are identical with,Elementary Forms
41360,those which the members of other totems believe that they sustain with,Elementary Forms
41360,"the founders of their respective clans. In the Alcheringa[1205] times,",Elementary Forms
41360,the Wollunqua traversed the country in every direction. In the different,Elementary Forms
41360,"localities where it stopped, it scattered ""spirit-children,"" the",Elementary Forms
41360,spiritual principles which still serve as the souls of the living of,Elementary Forms
41360,to-day. The Wollunqua is even considered as a sort of pre-eminent totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,"The Warramunga are divided into two phratries, called Uluuru and",Elementary Forms
41360,Kingilli. Nearly all the totems of the former are snakes of different,Elementary Forms
41360,kinds. Now they are all believed to be descended from the Wollunqua;,Elementary Forms
41360,"they say that it was their grandfather.[1206] From this, we can catch a",Elementary Forms
41360,glimpse of how the myth of the Wollunqua probably arose. In order to,Elementary Forms
41360,"explain the presence of so many similar totems in the same phratry, they",Elementary Forms
41360,imagined that all were derived from one and the same totem; it was,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to give it a gigantic form so that in its very appearance it,Elementary Forms
41360,might conform to the considerable role assigned to it in the history of,Elementary Forms
41360,the tribe.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now the Wollunqua is the object of ceremonies not differing in nature,Elementary Forms
41360,from those which we have already studied: they are representations in,Elementary Forms
41360,which are portrayed the principal events of its fabulous life. They show,Elementary Forms
41360,it coming out of the ground and passing from one locality to another;,Elementary Forms
41360,"they represent different episodes in its voyages, etc. Spencer and",Elementary Forms
41360,Gillen assisted at fifteen ceremonies of this sort which took place,Elementary Forms
41360,"between the 27th of July and the 23rd of August, all being linked",Elementary Forms
41360,"together in a determined order, in such a way as to form a veritable",Elementary Forms
41360,"cycle.[1207] In the details of the rites constituting it, this long",Elementary Forms
41360,celebration is therefore indistinct from the ordinary Intichiuma of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Warramunga, as is recognized by the authors who have described it to",Elementary Forms
41360,"us.[1208] But, on the other hand, it is an Intichiuma which could not",Elementary Forms
41360,have the object of assuring the fecundity of an animal or vegetable,Elementary Forms
41360,"species, for the Wollunqua is a species all by itself and does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduce. It exists, and the natives do not seem to feel that it has",Elementary Forms
41360,need of a cult to preserve it in its existence. These ceremonies not,Elementary Forms
41360,"only seem to lack the efficacy of the classic Intichiuma, but it even",Elementary Forms
41360,seems as though they have no material efficacy of any sort. The,Elementary Forms
41360,Wollunqua is not a divinity set over a special order of natural,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena, so they expect no definite service from him in exchange for",Elementary Forms
41360,the cult. Of course they say that if the ritual prescriptions are badly,Elementary Forms
41360,"observed, the Wollunqua becomes angry, leaves his retreat and comes to",Elementary Forms
41360,"punish his worshippers for their negligence; and inversely, when",Elementary Forms
41360,"everything passes regularly, they are led to believe that they will be",Elementary Forms
41360,fortunate and that some happy event will take place; but it is quite,Elementary Forms
41360,evident that these possible sanctions are an after-thought to explain,Elementary Forms
41360,"the rite. After the ceremony had been established, it seemed natural",Elementary Forms
41360,"that it should serve for something, and that the omission of the",Elementary Forms
41360,prescribed observances should therefore expose one to grave dangers. But,Elementary Forms
41360,it was not established to forestall these mythical dangers or to assure,Elementary Forms
41360,"particular advantages. The natives, moreover, have only the very haziest",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas of them. When the whole ceremony is completed, the old men",Elementary Forms
41360,"announce that if the Wollunqua is pleased, he will send rain. But it is",Elementary Forms
41360,not to have rain that they go through with the celebration.[1209] They,Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrate it because their ancestors did, because they are attached to",Elementary Forms
41360,it as to a highly respected tradition and because they leave it with a,Elementary Forms
41360,feeling of moral well-being. Other considerations have only a,Elementary Forms
41360,complimentary part; they may serve to strengthen the worshippers in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"attitude prescribed by the rite, but they are not the reason for the",Elementary Forms
41360,existence of this attitude.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,So we have here a whole group of ceremonies whose sole purpose is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"awaken certain ideas and sentiments, to attach the present to the past",Elementary Forms
41360,or the individual to the group. Not only are they unable to serve useful,Elementary Forms
41360,"ends, but the worshippers themselves demand none. This is still another",Elementary Forms
41360,proof that the psychical state in which the assembled group happens to,Elementary Forms
41360,be constitutes the only solid and stable basis of what we may call the,Elementary Forms
41360,ritual mentality. The beliefs which attribute such or such a physical,Elementary Forms
41360,"efficaciousness to the rites are wholly accessory and contingent, for",Elementary Forms
41360,they may be lacking without causing any alteration in the essentials of,Elementary Forms
41360,the rite. Thus the ceremonies of the Wollunqua show even better than the,Elementary Forms
41360,preceding ones the fundamental function of the positive cult.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If we have insisted especially upon these solemnities, it is because of",Elementary Forms
41360,their exceptional importance. But there are others with exactly the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"character. Thus, the Warramunga have a totem ""of the laughing boy.""",Elementary Forms
41360,Spencer and Gillen say that the clan bearing this name has the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"organization as the other totemic groups. Like them, it has its sacred",Elementary Forms
41360,places (_mungai_) where the founder-ancestor celebrated ceremonies in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the fabulous times, and where he left behind him spirit-children who",Elementary Forms
41360,became the men of the clan; the rites connected with this totem are,Elementary Forms
41360,indistinguishable from those relating to the animal or vegetable,Elementary Forms
41360,totems.[1210] Yet it is evident that they could not have any physical,Elementary Forms
41360,efficaciousness. They consist in a series of four ceremonies which,Elementary Forms
41360,"repeat one another more or less, but which are intended only to amuse",Elementary Forms
41360,"and to provoke laughter by laughter, in fine, to maintain the gaiety and",Elementary Forms
41360,good-humour which the group has as its speciality.[1211],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We find more than one totem among the Arunta themselves which has no,Elementary Forms
41360,"other Intichiuma. We have seen that among this people, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"irregularities and depressions of the land, which mark the places where",Elementary Forms
41360,"some ancestor sojourned, sometimes serve as totems.[1212] Ceremonies are",Elementary Forms
41360,attached to these totems which are manifestly incapable of physical,Elementary Forms
41360,effects of any sort. They can consist only in representations whose,Elementary Forms
41360,"object is to commemorate the past, and they can aim at no end beyond",Elementary Forms
41360,this commemoration.[1213],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"While they enable us to understand the nature of the cult better, these",Elementary Forms
41360,ritual representations also put into evidence an important element of,Elementary Forms
41360,religion: this is the recreative and esthetic element.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have already had occasion to show that they are closely akin to,Elementary Forms
41360,dramatic representations.[1214] This kinship appears with still greater,Elementary Forms
41360,clarity in the latter ceremonies of which we have spoken. Not only do,Elementary Forms
41360,"they employ the same processes as the real drama, but they also pursue",Elementary Forms
41360,"an end of the same sort: being foreign to all utilitarian ends, they",Elementary Forms
41360,make men forget the real world and transport them into another where,Elementary Forms
41360,their imagination is more at ease; they distract. They sometimes even go,Elementary Forms
41360,so far as to have the outward appearance of a recreation: the assistants,Elementary Forms
41360,may be seen laughing and amusing themselves openly.[1215],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Representative rites and collective recreations are even so close to one,Elementary Forms
41360,another that men pass from one sort to the other without any break of,Elementary Forms
41360,continuity. The characteristic feature of the properly religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies is that they must be celebrated on a consecrated ground, from",Elementary Forms
41360,which women and non-initiated persons are excluded.[1216] But there are,Elementary Forms
41360,"others in which this religious character is somewhat effaced, though it",Elementary Forms
41360,has not disappeared completely. They take place outside the ceremonial,Elementary Forms
41360,"ground, which proves that they are already laicized to a certain degree;",Elementary Forms
41360,"but profane persons, women and children, are not yet admitted to them.",Elementary Forms
41360,So they are on the boundary between the two domains. They generally deal,Elementary Forms
41360,"with legendary personages, but ones having no regular place in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"frame-work of the totemic religion. They are spirits, more generally",Elementary Forms
41360,"malevolent ones, having relations with the magicians rather than the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinary believers, and sorts of bugbears, in whom men do not believe",Elementary Forms
41360,with the same degree of seriousness and firmness of conviction as in the,Elementary Forms
41360,proper totemic beings and things.[1217] As the bonds by which the events,Elementary Forms
41360,and personages represented are attached to the history of the tribe,Elementary Forms
41360,"relax, these take on a proportionately more unreal appearance, while the",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding ceremonies change in nature. Thus men enter into the,Elementary Forms
41360,"domain of pure fancy, and pass from the commemorative rite to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinary corrobbori, a simple public merry-making, which has nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,religious about it and in which all may take part indifferently. Perhaps,Elementary Forms
41360,"some of these representations, whose sole object now is to distract, are",Elementary Forms
41360,"ancient rites, whose character has been changed. In fact, the",Elementary Forms
41360,distinction between these two sorts of ceremonies is so variable that it,Elementary Forms
41360,is impossible to state with precision to which of the two kinds they,Elementary Forms
41360,belong.[1218],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is a well-known fact that games and the principal forms of art seem,Elementary Forms
41360,to have been born of religion and that for a long time they retained a,Elementary Forms
41360,religious character.[1219] We now see what the reasons for this are: it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is because the cult, though aimed primarily at other ends, has also been",Elementary Forms
41360,a sort of recreation for men. Religion has not played this role by,Elementary Forms
41360,"hazard or owing to a happy chance, but through a necessity of its",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. Though, as we have established, religious thought is something",Elementary Forms
41360,"very different from a system of fictions, still the realities to which",Elementary Forms
41360,it corresponds express themselves religiously only when religion,Elementary Forms
41360,transfigures them. Between society as it is objectively and the sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"things which express it symbolically, the distance is considerable. It",Elementary Forms
41360,"has been necessary that the impressions really felt by men, which served",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the original matter of this construction, should be interpreted,",Elementary Forms
41360,elaborated and transformed until they became unrecognizable. So the,Elementary Forms
41360,"world of religious things is a partially imaginary world, though only in",Elementary Forms
41360,"its outward form, and one which therefore lends itself more readily to",Elementary Forms
41360,"the free creations of the mind. Also, since the intellectual forces",Elementary Forms
41360,"which serve to make it are intense and tumultuous, the unique task of",Elementary Forms
41360,expressing the real with the aid of appropriate symbols is not enough to,Elementary Forms
41360,occupy them. A surplus generally remains available which seeks to employ,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself in supplementary and superfluous works of luxury, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,in works of art. There are practices as well as beliefs of this sort.,Elementary Forms
41360,The state of effervescence in which the assembled worshippers find,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves must be translated outwardly by exuberant movements which are,Elementary Forms
41360,"not easily subjected to too carefully defined ends. In part, they escape",Elementary Forms
41360,"aimlessly, they spread themselves for the mere pleasure of so doing, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"they take delight in all sorts of games. Besides, in so far as the",Elementary Forms
41360,"beings to whom the cult is addressed are imaginary, they are not able to",Elementary Forms
41360,contain and regulate this exuberance; the pressure of tangible and,Elementary Forms
41360,resisting realities is required to confine activities to exact and,Elementary Forms
41360,economical forms. Therefore one exposes oneself to grave,Elementary Forms
41360,"misunderstandings if, in explaining rites, he believes that each gesture",Elementary Forms
41360,has a precise object and a definite reason for its existence. There are,Elementary Forms
41360,some which serve nothing; they merely answer the need felt by,Elementary Forms
41360,"worshippers for action, motion, gesticulation. They are to be seen",Elementary Forms
41360,"jumping, whirling, dancing, crying and singing, though it may not always",Elementary Forms
41360,be possible to give a meaning to all this agitation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore religion would not be itself if it did not give some place to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the free combinations of thought and activity, to play, to art, to all",Elementary Forms
41360,that recreates the spirit that has been fatigued by the too great,Elementary Forms
41360,slavishness of daily work: the very same causes which called it into,Elementary Forms
41360,existence make it a necessity. Art is not merely an external ornament,Elementary Forms
41360,with which the cult has adorned itself in order to dissimulate certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"of its features which may be too austere and too rude; but rather, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, the cult is something aesthetic. Owing to the well-known",Elementary Forms
41360,"connection which mythology has with poetry, some have wished to exclude",Elementary Forms
41360,the former from religion;[1220] the truth is that there is a poetry,Elementary Forms
41360,inherent in all religion. The representative rites which have just been,Elementary Forms
41360,studied make this aspect of the religious life manifest; but there are,Elementary Forms
41360,scarcely any rites which do not present it to some degree.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One would certainly commit the gravest error if he saw only this one,Elementary Forms
41360,"aspect of religion, or if he even exaggerated its importance. When a",Elementary Forms
41360,"rite serves only to distract, it is no longer a rite. The moral forces",Elementary Forms
41360,expressed by religious symbols are real forces with which we must reckon,Elementary Forms
41360,and with which we cannot do what we will. Even when the cult aims at,Elementary Forms
41360,"producing no physical effects, but limits itself to acting on the mind,",Elementary Forms
41360,its action is in quite a different way from that of a pure work of art.,Elementary Forms
41360,The representations which it seeks to awaken and maintain in our minds,Elementary Forms
41360,"are not vain images which correspond to nothing in reality, and which we",Elementary Forms
41360,call up aimlessly for the mere satisfaction of seeing them appear and,Elementary Forms
41360,combine before our eyes. They are as necessary for the well working of,Elementary Forms
41360,"our moral life as our food is for the maintenance of our physical life,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for it is through them that the group affirms and maintains itself, and",Elementary Forms
41360,we know the point to which this is indispensable for the individual. So,Elementary Forms
41360,a rite is something different from a game; it is a part of the serious,Elementary Forms
41360,"life. But if its unreal and imaginary element is not essential,",Elementary Forms
41360,nevertheless it plays a part which is by no means negligible. It has its,Elementary Forms
41360,share in the feeling of comfort which the worshipper draws from the rite,Elementary Forms
41360,performed; for recreation is one of the forms of the moral remaking,Elementary Forms
41360,which is the principal object of the positive rite. After we have,Elementary Forms
41360,"acquitted ourselves of our ritual duties, we enter into the profane life",Elementary Forms
41360,"with increased courage and ardour, not only because we come into",Elementary Forms
41360,"relations with a superior source of energy, but also because our forces",Elementary Forms
41360,"have been reinvigorated by living, for a few moments, in a life that is",Elementary Forms
41360,"less strained, and freer and easier. Hence religion acquires a charm",Elementary Forms
41360,which is not among the slightest of its attractions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This is why the very idea of a religious ceremony of some importance,Elementary Forms
41360,"awakens the idea of a feast. Inversely, every feast, even when it has",Elementary Forms
41360,"purely lay origins, has certain characteristics of the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony, for in every case its effect is to bring men together, to put",Elementary Forms
41360,"the masses into movement and thus to excite a state of effervescence,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and sometimes even of delirium, which is not without a certain kinship",Elementary Forms
41360,with the religious state. A man is carried outside himself and diverted,Elementary Forms
41360,from his ordinary occupation and preoccupations. Thus the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"manifestations are to be observed in each case: cries, songs, music,",Elementary Forms
41360,"violent movements, dances, the search for exciteants which raise the",Elementary Forms
41360,"vital level, etc. It has frequently been remarked that popular feasts",Elementary Forms
41360,"lead to excesses, and cause men to lose sight of the distinction",Elementary Forms
41360,separating the licit from the illicit;[1221] there are also religious,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies which make it almost necessary to violate the rules which are,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily the most respected.[1222] Of course this does not mean that,Elementary Forms
41360,there is no way to distinguish these two forms of public activity. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"simple merry-making, the profane corrobbori, has no serious object,",Elementary Forms
41360,"while, as a whole, a ritual ceremony always has an important end. Still",Elementary Forms
41360,it is to be remembered that there is perhaps no merry-making in which,Elementary Forms
41360,the serious life does not have some echo. The difference consists rather,Elementary Forms
41360,in the unequal proportions in which the two elements are combined.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A more general fact confirms the views which precede.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In their first book, Spencer and Gillen presented the Intichiuma as a",Elementary Forms
41360,perfectly definite ritual entity: they spoke of it as though it were an,Elementary Forms
41360,operation destined exclusively for the assurance of the reproduction of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the totemic species, and it seemed as though it ought to lose all",Elementary Forms
41360,"meaning, if this unique function were set aside. But in their _Northern",Elementary Forms
41360,"Tribes of Central Australia_, the same authors use a different language,",Elementary Forms
41360,though perhaps without noticing it. They recognize that these same,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies may take place either in the regular Intichiuma or in the,Elementary Forms
41360,initiation rites.[1223] So they serve equally in the making of animals,Elementary Forms
41360,"or plants of the totemic species, or in conferring upon novices the",Elementary Forms
41360,qualities necessary to make them regular members of the men's,Elementary Forms
41360,"society.[1224] From this point of view, the Intichiuma takes on a new",Elementary Forms
41360,"aspect. It is no longer a distinct ritual mechanism, resting upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"principles of its own, but a particular application of more general",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies which may be utilized for very different ends. For this,Elementary Forms
41360,"reason, in their later work, before speaking of the Intichiuma and the",Elementary Forms
41360,initiation they consecrate a special chapter to the totemic ceremonies,Elementary Forms
41360,"in general, making abstraction of the diverse forms which they may take,",Elementary Forms
41360,according to the ends for which they are employed.[1225],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This fundamental indetermination of the totemic ceremonies was only,Elementary Forms
41360,"indicated by Spencer and Gillen, and rather indirectly at that; but it",Elementary Forms
41360,"has now been confirmed by Strehlow in more explicit terms. ""When they",Elementary Forms
41360,"lead the young novices through the different feasts of the initiation,""",Elementary Forms
41360,"he says, ""they perform before them a series of ceremonies which, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"reproducing, even in their most characteristic details, the rites of the",Elementary Forms
41360,regular cult (viz. _the rites which Spencer and Gillen call the,Elementary Forms
41360,"Intichiuma_), do not have, nevertheless, the end of multiplying the",Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponding totem and causing it to prosper.""[1226] It is the same",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremony which serves in the two cases; the name alone is not the same.,Elementary Forms
41360,"When its special object is the reproduction of the species, they call it",Elementary Forms
41360,_mbatjalkatiuma_ and it is only when it is a part of the process of,Elementary Forms
41360,initiation that they give it the name Intichiuma.[1227],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, these two sorts of ceremonies are distinguished from one",Elementary Forms
41360,another among the Arunta by certain secondary characteristics. Though,Elementary Forms
41360,"the structure of the rite is the same in both cases, still we know that",Elementary Forms
41360,"the effusions of blood and, more generally, the oblations characteristic",Elementary Forms
41360,of the Arunta Intichiuma are not found in the initiation ceremonies.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, among this same people, the Intichiuma takes place at",Elementary Forms
41360,"a spot regularly fixed by tradition, to which men must make a",Elementary Forms
41360,"pilgrimage, while the scene of the initiation ceremonies is purely",Elementary Forms
41360,conventional.[1228] But when the Intichiuma consists in a simple,Elementary Forms
41360,"dramatic representation, as is the case among the Warramunga, the lack",Elementary Forms
41360,of distinction between the two rites is complete. In the one as in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other, they commemorate the past, they put the myth into action, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"play--and one cannot play in two materially different ways. So,",Elementary Forms
41360,"according to the circumstances, one and the same ceremony serves two",Elementary Forms
41360,distinct functions.[1229],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It may even lend itself to other uses. We know that as blood is a sacred,Elementary Forms
41360,"thing, women must not see it flow. Yet it happens sometimes that a",Elementary Forms
41360,quarrel breaks out in their presence and ends in the shedding of blood.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus an infraction of the ritual is committed. Among the Arunta, the man",Elementary Forms
41360,"whose blood flowed first must, to atone for this fault, ""celebrate a",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremony connected with the totem either of his father or of his,Elementary Forms
41360,"mother"";[1230] this ceremony has a special name, _Alua uparilima_, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"means the washing away of blood. But in itself, it does not differ from",Elementary Forms
41360,those celebrated at the time of the initiation or in the Intichiuma: it,Elementary Forms
41360,represents an event of ancestral history. So it may serve equally to,Elementary Forms
41360,"initiate, to act upon the totemic species or to expiate a sacrilege. We",Elementary Forms
41360,shall see that a totemic ceremony may also take the place of a funeral,Elementary Forms
41360,rite.[1231],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,MM. Hubert and Mauss have already pointed out a functional ambiguity of,Elementary Forms
41360,"this same sort in the case of sacrifice, and more especially, in that of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Hindu sacrifice.[1232] They have shown how the sacrifice of communion,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that of expiation, that of a vow and that of a contract are only",Elementary Forms
41360,variations of one and the same mechanism. We now see that the fact is,Elementary Forms
41360,"much more primitive, and in no way limited to the institution of",Elementary Forms
41360,sacrifice. Perhaps no rite exists which does not present a similar,Elementary Forms
41360,indetermination. The mass serves for marriages as for burials; it,Elementary Forms
41360,redeems the faults of the dead and wins the favours of the deity for the,Elementary Forms
41360,"living, etc. Fasting is an expiation and a penance; but it is also a",Elementary Forms
41360,preparation for communion; it even confers positive virtues. This,Elementary Forms
41360,ambiguity shows that the real function of a rite does not consist in the,Elementary Forms
41360,particular and definite effects which it seems to aim at and by which it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is ordinarily characterized, but rather in a general action which,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though always and everywhere the same, is nevertheless capable of taking",Elementary Forms
41360,on different forms according to the circumstances. Now this is just what,Elementary Forms
41360,is demanded by the theory which we have proposed. If the real function,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the cult is to awaken within the worshippers a certain state of soul,",Elementary Forms
41360,"composed of moral force and confidence, and if the various effects",Elementary Forms
41360,imputed to the rites are due only to a secondary and variable,Elementary Forms
41360,"determination of this fundamental state, it is not surprising if a",Elementary Forms
41360,"single rite, while keeping the same composition and structure, seems to",Elementary Forms
41360,"produce various effects. For the mental dispositions, the excitation of",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is its permanent function, remain the same in every case; they",Elementary Forms
41360,"depend upon the fact that the group is assembled, and not upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"special reasons for which it is assembled. But, on the other hand, they",Elementary Forms
41360,are interpreted differently according to the circumstances to which they,Elementary Forms
41360,are applied. Is it a physical result which they wish to obtain? The,Elementary Forms
41360,confidence they feel convinces them that the desired result is or will,Elementary Forms
41360,be obtained by the means employed. Has some one committed a fault for,Elementary Forms
41360,which he wishes to atone? The same state of moral assurance will lead,Elementary Forms
41360,"him to attribute expiatory virtues to these same ritual gestures. Thus,",Elementary Forms
41360,the apparent efficacy will seem to change while the real efficacy,Elementary Forms
41360,"remains invariable, and the rite will seem to fulfil various functions",Elementary Forms
41360,"though in fact it has only one, which is always the same.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Inversely, just as a single rite may serve many ends, so many rites may",Elementary Forms
41360,produce the same effect and mutually replace one another. To assure the,Elementary Forms
41360,"reproduction of the totemic species, one may have recourse equally to",Elementary Forms
41360,"oblations, to imitative practices or to commemorative representations.",Elementary Forms
41360,This aptitude of rites for substituting themselves for one another,Elementary Forms
41360,proves once more both their plasticity and the extreme generality of the,Elementary Forms
41360,useful action which they exercise. The essential thing is that men are,Elementary Forms
41360,"assembled, that sentiments are felt in common and expressed in common",Elementary Forms
41360,acts; but the particular nature of these sentiments and acts is,Elementary Forms
41360,something relatively secondary and contingent. To become conscious of,Elementary Forms
41360,"itself, the group does not need to perform certain acts in preference to",Elementary Forms
41360,all others. The necessary thing is that it partakes of the same thought,Elementary Forms
41360,and the same action; the visible forms in which this communion takes,Elementary Forms
41360,"place matter but little. Of course, these external forms do not come by",Elementary Forms
41360,chance; they have their reasons; but these reasons do not touch the,Elementary Forms
41360,essential part of the cult.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So everything leads us back to this same idea: before all, rites are",Elementary Forms
41360,means by which the social group reaffirms itself periodically. From,Elementary Forms
41360,"this, we may be able to reconstruct hypothetically the way in which the",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic cult should have arisen originally. Men who feel themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,"united, partially by bonds of blood, but still more by a community of",Elementary Forms
41360,"interest and tradition, assemble and become conscious of their moral",Elementary Forms
41360,"unity. For the reasons which we have set forth, they are led to",Elementary Forms
41360,represent this unity in the form of a very special kind of,Elementary Forms
41360,consubstantiality: they think of themselves as all participating in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of some determined animal. Under these circumstances, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,only one way for them to affirm their collective existence: this is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"affirm that they are like the animals of this species, and to do so not",Elementary Forms
41360,"only in the silence of their own thoughts, but also by material acts.",Elementary Forms
41360,"These are the acts which make up the cult, and they obviously can",Elementary Forms
41360,consist only in movements by which the man imitates the animal with,Elementary Forms
41360,"which he identifies himself. When understood thus, the imitative rites",Elementary Forms
41360,appear as the first form of the cult. It will be thought that this is,Elementary Forms
41360,attributing a very considerable historical importance to practices,Elementary Forms
41360,"which, at first view, give the effect of childish games. But, as we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"shown, these naive and awkward gestures and these crude processes of",Elementary Forms
41360,"representation translate and maintain a sentiment of pride, confidence",Elementary Forms
41360,and veneration wholly comparable to that expressed by the worshippers in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the most idealistic religions when, being assembled, they proclaim",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves the children of the almighty God. For in the one case as in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the other, this sentiment is made up of the same impressions of security",Elementary Forms
41360,and respect which are awakened in individual consciousnesses by this,Elementary Forms
41360,"great moral force which dominates them and sustains them, and which is",Elementary Forms
41360,the collective force.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The other rites which we have been studying are probably only variations,Elementary Forms
41360,of this essential rite. When the close union of the animal and men has,Elementary Forms
41360,"once been admitted, men feel acutely the necessity of assuring the",Elementary Forms
41360,regular reproduction of the principal object of the cult. These,Elementary Forms
41360,"imitative practices, which probably had only a moral end at first, thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"became subordinated to utilitarian and material ends, and they were",Elementary Forms
41360,thought of as means of producing the desired result. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"proportionately as, through the development of mythology, the ancestral",Elementary Forms
41360,"hero, who was at first confused with the totemic animal, distinguished",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself more and more, and became a more personal figure, the imitation",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the ancestor was substituted for the imitation of the animal, or took",Elementary Forms
41360,"a place beside it, and then representative ceremonies replaced or",Elementary Forms
41360,"completed the imitative rites. Finally, to be surer of attaining the end",Elementary Forms
41360,"they sought, men felt the need of putting into action all the means at",Elementary Forms
41360,their disposal. Close at hand they had reserves of living forces,Elementary Forms
41360,"accumulated in the sacred rocks, so they utilized them; since the blood",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the men was of the same nature as that of the animal, they used it",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the same purpose and shed it. Inversely, owing to this same kinship,",Elementary Forms
41360,men used the flesh of the animal to remake their own substance. Hence,Elementary Forms
41360,"came the rites of oblation and communion. But, at bottom, all these",Elementary Forms
41360,different practices are only variations of one and the same theme:,Elementary Forms
41360,"everywhere their basis is the same state of mind, interpreted",Elementary Forms
41360,"differently according to the situations, the moments of history and the",Elementary Forms
41360,dispositions of the worshippers.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Howsoever much they may differ from one another in the nature of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"gestures they imply, the positive rites which we have been passing under",Elementary Forms
41360,review have one common characteristic: they are all performed in a state,Elementary Forms
41360,"of confidence, joy and even enthusiasm. Though the expectation of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"future and contingent event is not without a certain uncertainty, still",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is normal that the rain fall when the season for it comes, and that",Elementary Forms
41360,the animal and vegetable species reproduce regularly. Oft-repeated,Elementary Forms
41360,experiences have shown that the rites generally do produce the effects,Elementary Forms
41360,which are expected of them and which are the reason for their existence.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Men celebrate them with confidence, joyfully anticipating the happy",Elementary Forms
41360,event which they prepare and announce. Whatever movements men perform,Elementary Forms
41360,"participate in this same state of mind: of course, they are marked with",Elementary Forms
41360,"the gravity which a religious solemnity always supposes, but this",Elementary Forms
41360,gravity excludes neither animation nor joy.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"These are all joyful feasts. But there are sad celebrations as well,",Elementary Forms
41360,"whose object is either to meet a calamity, or else merely to commemorate",Elementary Forms
41360,"and deplore it. These rites have a special aspect, which we are going to",Elementary Forms
41360,attempt to characterize and explain. It is the more necessary to study,Elementary Forms
41360,them by themselves since they are going to reveal a new aspect of the,Elementary Forms
41360,religious life to us.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We propose to call the ceremonies of this sort piacular. The term,Elementary Forms
41360,_piaculum_ has the advantage that while it suggests the idea of,Elementary Forms
41360,"expiation, it also has a much more extended signification. Every",Elementary Forms
41360,"misfortune, everything of evil omen, everything that inspires sentiments",Elementary Forms
41360,of sorrow or fear necessitates a _piaculum_ and is therefore called,Elementary Forms
41360,piacular.[1233] So this word seems to be very well adapted for,Elementary Forms
41360,designating the rites which are celebrated by those in a state of,Elementary Forms
41360,uneasiness or sadness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Mourning offers us a first and important example of piacular rites.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, a distinction is necessary between the different rites which go",Elementary Forms
41360,to make up mourning. Some consist in mere abstentions: it is forbidden,Elementary Forms
41360,"to pronounce the name of the dead,[1234] or to remain near the place",Elementary Forms
41360,"where the death occurred;[1235] relatives, especially the female ones,",Elementary Forms
41360,must abstain from all communication with strangers;[1236] the ordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,"occupations of life are suspended, just as in feast-time,[1237] etc. All",Elementary Forms
41360,these practices belong to the negative cult and are explained like the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other rites of the same sort, so they do not concern us at present. They",Elementary Forms
41360,"are due to the fact that the dead man is a sacred being. Consequently,",Elementary Forms
41360,"everything which is or has been connected with him is, by contagion, in",Elementary Forms
41360,a religious state excluding all contact with things from profane life.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But mourning is not made up entirely of interdicts which have to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"observed. Positive acts are also demanded, in which the relatives are",Elementary Forms
41360,both the actors and those acted upon.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Very frequently these rites commence as soon as the death appears,Elementary Forms
41360,imminent. Here is a scene which Spencer and Gillen witnessed among the,Elementary Forms
41360,Warramunga. A totemic ceremony had just been celebrated and the company,Elementary Forms
41360,of actors and spectators was leaving the consecrated ground when a,Elementary Forms
41360,piercing cry suddenly came from the camp: a man was dying there. At,Elementary Forms
41360,"once, the whole company commenced to run as fast as they could, while",Elementary Forms
41360,"most of them commenced to howl. ""Between us and the camp,"" say these",Elementary Forms
41360,"observers, ""lay a deep creek, and on the bank of this, some of the men,",Elementary Forms
41360,"scattered about here and there, sat down, bending their heads forwards",Elementary Forms
41360,"between their knees, while they wept and moaned. Crossing the creek we",Elementary Forms
41360,"found that, as usual, the men's camp had been pulled to pieces. Some of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the women, who had come from every direction, were lying prostrate on",Elementary Forms
41360,"the body, while others were standing or kneeling around, digging the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sharp ends of yam-sticks into the crown of their heads, from which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"blood streamed down over their faces, while all the time they kept up a",Elementary Forms
41360,"loud, continuous wail. Many of the men, rushing up to the spot, threw",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves upon the body, from which the women arose when the men",Elementary Forms
41360,"approached, until in a few minutes we could see nothing but a struggling",Elementary Forms
41360,"mass of bodies all mixed up together. To one side, three men of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thapungarti class, who still wore their ceremonial decorations, sat down",Elementary Forms
41360,"wailing loudly, with their backs towards the dying man, and in a minute",Elementary Forms
41360,or two another man of the same class rushed on to the ground yelling and,Elementary Forms
41360,"brandishing a stone knife. Reaching the camp, he suddenly gashed both",Elementary Forms
41360,"thighs deeply, cutting right across the muscles, and, unable to stand,",Elementary Forms
41360,"fell down into the middle of the group, from which he was dragged out",Elementary Forms
41360,"after a time by three or four female relatives, who immediately applied",Elementary Forms
41360,"their mouths to the gaping wounds while he lay exhausted on the ground.""",Elementary Forms
41360,The man did not actually die until late in the evening. As soon as he,Elementary Forms
41360,"had given up his last breath, the same scene was re-enacted, only this",Elementary Forms
41360,"time the wailing was still louder, and men and women, seized by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"veritable frenzy, were rushing about cutting themselves with knives and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sharp-pointed sticks, the women battering one another's heads with",Elementary Forms
41360,"fighting clubs, no one attempting to ward off either cuts or blows.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, after about an hour, a torchlight procession started off across",Elementary Forms
41360,"the plain, to a tree in whose branches the body was left.[1238]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Howsoever great the violence of these manifestations may be, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,strictly regulated by etiquette. The individuals who make bloody,Elementary Forms
41360,incisions in themselves are designated by usage: they must have certain,Elementary Forms
41360,"relations of kinship with the dead man. Thus, in the case observed by",Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen among the Warramunga, those who slashed their thighs",Elementary Forms
41360,"were the maternal grandfather of the deceased, his maternal uncle, and",Elementary Forms
41360,the maternal uncle and brother of his wife.[1239] Others must cut their,Elementary Forms
41360,"whiskers and hair, and then smear their scalps with pipe-clay. Women",Elementary Forms
41360,have particularly severe obligations. They must cut their hair and cover,Elementary Forms
41360,"the whole body with pipe-clay; in addition to this, a strict silence is",Elementary Forms
41360,"imposed upon them during the whole period of mourning, which may last as",Elementary Forms
41360,"long as two years. It is not rare among the Warramunga that, as a result",Elementary Forms
41360,"of this interdiction, all the women of a camp are condemned to the most",Elementary Forms
41360,absolute silence. This becomes so habitual to them that even after the,Elementary Forms
41360,"expiration of the period of mourning, they voluntarily renounce all",Elementary Forms
41360,"spoken language and prefer to communicate with gestures--in which, by",Elementary Forms
41360,"the way, they acquire a remarkable ability. Spencer and Gillen knew one",Elementary Forms
41360,old woman who had not spoken for over twenty-four years.[1240],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The ceremony which we have described opens a long series of rites which,Elementary Forms
41360,succeed one another for weeks and even for months. During the days which,Elementary Forms
41360,"follow, they are renewed in various forms. Groups of men and women sit",Elementary Forms
41360,"on the ground, weeping and lamenting, and kissing each other at certain",Elementary Forms
41360,moments. These ritual kissings are repeated frequently during the period,Elementary Forms
41360,of mourning. It seems as though men felt a need of coming close together,Elementary Forms
41360,and communicating most closely; they are to be seen holding to each,Elementary Forms
41360,"other and wound together so much as to make one single mass, from which",Elementary Forms
41360,"loud groans escape.[1241] Meanwhile, the women commence to lacerate",Elementary Forms
41360,"their heads again, and, in order to intensify the wounds they make, they",Elementary Forms
41360,even go so far as to burn them with the points of fiery sticks.[1242],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Practices of this sort are general in all Australia. The funeral rites,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that is, the ritual cares given to the corpse, the way in which it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"buried, etc., change with different tribes,[1243] and in a single tribe",Elementary Forms
41360,"they vary with the age, sex and social importance of the",Elementary Forms
41360,individual.[1244] But the real ceremonies of mourning repeat the same,Elementary Forms
41360,theme everywhere; the variations are only in the details. Everywhere we,Elementary Forms
41360,"find this same silence interrupted by groans,[1245] the same obligation",Elementary Forms
41360,"of cutting the hair and beard,[1246] or of covering one's head with",Elementary Forms
41360,"pipe-clay or cinders, or perhaps even with excrements;[1247] everywhere,",Elementary Forms
41360,"finally, we find this same frenzy for beating one's self, lacerating",Elementary Forms
41360,"one's self and burning one's self. In central Victoria, ""when death",Elementary Forms
41360,"visits a tribe there is great weeping and lamentation amongst the women,",Elementary Forms
41360,the elder portion of whom lacerate their temples with their nails. The,Elementary Forms
41360,"parents of the deceased lacerate themselves fearfully, especially if it",Elementary Forms
41360,be an only son whose loss they deplore. The father beats and cuts his,Elementary Forms
41360,"head with a tomahawk until he utters bitter groans, the mother sits by",Elementary Forms
41360,the fire and burns her breasts and abdomen with a small fire-stick.,Elementary Forms
41360,Sometimes the burns thus inflicted are so severe as to cause,Elementary Forms
41360,"death.""[1248]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"According to an account of Brough Smyth, here is what happens in one of",Elementary Forms
41360,the southern tribes of the same state. As the body is lowered into the,Elementary Forms
41360,"grave, ""the widow begins her sad ceremonies. She cuts off her hair above",Elementary Forms
41360,"her forehead, and becoming frantic, seizes fire-sticks, and burns her",Elementary Forms
41360,"breasts, arms, legs and thighs. She seems to delight in the",Elementary Forms
41360,self-inflicted torture. It would be rash and vain to interrupt her. When,Elementary Forms
41360,"exhausted, and when she can hardly walk, she yet endeavours to kick the",Elementary Forms
41360,"embers of the fire, and to throw them about. Sitting down, she takes the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ashes into her hands, rubs them into her wounds, and then scratches her",Elementary Forms
41360,face (the only part not touched by the fire-sticks) until the blood,Elementary Forms
41360,"mingles with the ashes, which partly hide her cruel wounds. In this",Elementary Forms
41360,"plight, scratching her face continually, she utters howls and",Elementary Forms
41360,"lamentations.""[1249]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The description which Howitt gives of the rites of mourning among the,Elementary Forms
41360,Kurnai is remarkably similar to these others. After the body has been,Elementary Forms
41360,"wrapped up in opossum skins and put in a shroud of bark, a hut is built",Elementary Forms
41360,"in which the relatives assemble. ""There they lay lamenting their loss,",Elementary Forms
41360,"saying, for instance, 'Why did you leave us?' Now and then their grief",Elementary Forms
41360,"would be intensified by some one, for instance, the wife, uttering an",Elementary Forms
41360,"ear-piercing wail, 'My spouse is dead,' or another would say, 'My child",Elementary Forms
41360,is dead.' All the others would then join in with the proper term of,Elementary Forms
41360,"relationship, and they would gash themselves with sharp stones and",Elementary Forms
41360,tomahawks until their heads and bodies streamed with blood. This bitter,Elementary Forms
41360,"wailing and weeping continued all night.""[1250]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Sadness is not the only sentiment expressed during these ceremonies; a,Elementary Forms
41360,sort of anger is generally mixed with it. The relatives feel a need of,Elementary Forms
41360,avenging the death in some way or other. They are to be seen throwing,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves upon one another and trying to wound each other. Sometimes,Elementary Forms
41360,the attack is real; sometimes it is only pretended.[1251] There are even,Elementary Forms
41360,"cases when these peculiar combats are organized. Among the Kaitish, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"hair of the deceased passes by right to his son-in-law. But he, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"return, must go, in company with some of his relatives and friends, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"provoke a quarrel with one of his tribal brothers, that is, with a man",Elementary Forms
41360,belonging to the same matrimonial class as himself and one who might,Elementary Forms
41360,therefore have married the daughter of the dead man. This provocation,Elementary Forms
41360,cannot be refused and the two combatants inflict serious wounds upon,Elementary Forms
41360,"each other's shoulders and thighs. When the duel is terminated, the",Elementary Forms
41360,challenger passes on to his adversary the hair which he had temporarily,Elementary Forms
41360,inherited. This latter then provokes and fights with another of his,Elementary Forms
41360,"tribal brothers, to whom the precious relic is next transmitted, but",Elementary Forms
41360,only provisionally; thus it passes from hand to hand and circulates from,Elementary Forms
41360,"group to group.[1252] Also, something of these same sentiments enters",Elementary Forms
41360,"into that sort of rage with which each relative beats himself, burns",Elementary Forms
41360,himself or slashes himself: a sorrow which reaches such a paroxysm is,Elementary Forms
41360,not without a certain amount of anger. One cannot fail to be struck by,Elementary Forms
41360,the resemblances which these practices present to those of the vendetta.,Elementary Forms
41360,Both proceed from the same principle that death demands the shedding of,Elementary Forms
41360,blood. The only difference is that in one case the victims are the,Elementary Forms
41360,"relatives, while in the other they are strangers. We do not have to",Elementary Forms
41360,"treat especially of the vendetta, which belongs rather to the study of",Elementary Forms
41360,"juridic institutions; but it should be pointed out, nevertheless, how it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is connected with the rites of mourning, whose end it announces.[1253]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In certain societies, the mourning is terminated by a ceremony whose",Elementary Forms
41360,effervescence reaches or surpasses that produced by the inaugural,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies. Among the Arunta, this closing rite is called _Urpmilchima_.",Elementary Forms
41360,Spencer and Gillen assisted at two of these rites. One was celebrated in,Elementary Forms
41360,"honour of a man, the other of a woman. Here is the description they give",Elementary Forms
41360,of the latter.[1254],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"They commence by making some ornaments of a special sort, called",Elementary Forms
41360,_Chimurilia_ by the men and _Aramurilia_ by the women. With a kind of,Elementary Forms
41360,"resin, they fixed small animal bones, which had previously been gathered",Elementary Forms
41360,"and set aside, to locks of hair furnished by the relatives of the dead",Elementary Forms
41360,woman. These are then attached to one of the head-bands which women,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily wear and the feathers of black cockatoos and parrots are,Elementary Forms
41360,"added to it. When these preparations are completed, the women assemble",Elementary Forms
41360,"in their camp. They paint their bodies different colours, according to",Elementary Forms
41360,their degree of kinship with the deceased. After being embraced by one,Elementary Forms
41360,"another for some ten minutes, while uttering uninterrupted groans, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"set out for the tomb. At a certain distance, they meet a brother by",Elementary Forms
41360,"blood of the dead woman, who is accompanied by some of his tribal",Elementary Forms
41360,"brothers. Everybody sits down on the ground, and the lamentations",Elementary Forms
41360,recommence. A _pitchi_[1255] containing the Chimurilia is then presented,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the elder brother, who presses it against his stomach; they say that",Elementary Forms
41360,this is a way of lessening his sorrow. They take out one of the,Elementary Forms
41360,Chimurilia and the dead woman's mother puts it on her head for a little,Elementary Forms
41360,"while; then it is put back into the _pitchi_, which each of the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"men presses against his breast, in his turn. Finally, the brother puts",Elementary Forms
41360,the Chimurilia on the heads of two elder sisters and they set out again,Elementary Forms
41360,"for the tomb. On the way, the mother throws herself on the ground",Elementary Forms
41360,"several times, and tries to slash her head with a pointed stick. Every",Elementary Forms
41360,"time, the other women pick her up, and seem to take care that she does",Elementary Forms
41360,"not hurt herself too much. When they arrive at the tomb, she throws",Elementary Forms
41360,"herself on the knoll and endeavours to destroy it with her hands, while",Elementary Forms
41360,the other women literally dance upon her. The tribal mothers and aunts,Elementary Forms
41360,(sisters of the dead woman's father) follow her example; they also throw,Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves on the ground, and mutually beat and tear each other; finally",Elementary Forms
41360,"their bodies are all streaming with blood. After a while, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,dragged aside. The elder sisters then make a hole in the earth of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"tomb, in which they place the Chimurilia, which had previously been torn",Elementary Forms
41360,to pieces. Once again the tribal mothers throw themselves on the ground,Elementary Forms
41360,"and slash each other's heads. At this moment, ""the weeping and wailing",Elementary Forms
41360,of the women who were standing round seemed to drive them almost,Elementary Forms
41360,"frenzied, and the blood, streaming down their bodies over the white",Elementary Forms
41360,"pipe-clay, gave them a ghastly appearance. At last only the old mother",Elementary Forms
41360,"was left crouching alone, utterly exhausted and moaning weakly on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"grave.""[1256] Then the others raised her up and rubbed off the pipe-clay",Elementary Forms
41360,with which she was covered; this was the end of the ceremony and of the,Elementary Forms
41360,mourning.[1256],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Warramunga, the final rite presents some rather particular",Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristics. There seems to be no shedding of blood here, but the",Elementary Forms
41360,collective effervescence is translated in another manner.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among his people, before the body is definitely interred, it is exposed",Elementary Forms
41360,upon a platform placed in the branches of a tree; it is left there to,Elementary Forms
41360,"decompose slowly, until nothing remains but the bones. Then these are",Elementary Forms
41360,"gathered together and, with the exception of the humerus, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"placed inside an ant-hill. The humerus is wrapped up in a bark box,",Elementary Forms
41360,which is decorated in different manners. The box is then brought to,Elementary Forms
41360,"camp, amid the cries and groans of the women. During the following days,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they celebrate a series of totemic rites, concerning the totem of the",Elementary Forms
41360,deceased and the mythical history of the ancestors from whom the clan is,Elementary Forms
41360,"descended. When all these ceremonies have been terminated, they proceed",Elementary Forms
41360,to the closing rite.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,A trench one foot deep and fifteen feet long is dug in the field of the,Elementary Forms
41360,ceremony. A design representing the totem of the deceased and certain,Elementary Forms
41360,spots where the ancestor stopped is made on the ground a little distance,Elementary Forms
41360,"from it. Near this design, a little ditch is dug in the ground. Ten",Elementary Forms
41360,"decorated men then advance, one behind another, and with their hands",Elementary Forms
41360,crossed behind their heads and their legs wide apart they stand,Elementary Forms
41360,"astraddle the trench. At a given signal, the women run from the camp in",Elementary Forms
41360,"a profound silence; when they are near, they form in Indian file, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"last one holding in her hands the box containing the humerus. Then,",Elementary Forms
41360,"after throwing themselves on the ground, they advance on their hands and",Elementary Forms
41360,"knees, and pass all along the trench, between the legs of the men. The",Elementary Forms
41360,scene shows a state of great sexual excitement. As soon as the last,Elementary Forms
41360,"woman has passed, they take the box from her, and take it to the ditch,",Elementary Forms
41360,"near which is an old man; he breaks the bone with a sharp blow, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"hurriedly buries it in the debris. During this time, the women have",Elementary Forms
41360,"remained at a distance, with their backs turned upon the scene, for they",Elementary Forms
41360,"must not see it. But when they hear the blow of the axe, they flee,",Elementary Forms
41360,uttering cries and groans. The rite is accomplished; the mourning is,Elementary Forms
41360,terminated.[1257],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These rites belong to a very different type from those which we have,Elementary Forms
41360,studied hitherto. We do not mean to say that important resemblances,Elementary Forms
41360,"cannot be found between the two, which we shall have to note; but the",Elementary Forms
41360,"differences are more apparent. Instead of happy dances, songs and",Elementary Forms
41360,"dramatic representations which distract and relax the mind, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"tears and groans and, in a word, the most varied manifestations of",Elementary Forms
41360,"agonized sorrow and a sort of mutual pity, which occupy the whole scene.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Of course the shedding of blood also takes place in the Intichiuma, but",Elementary Forms
41360,this is an oblation made with a movement of pious enthusiasm. Even,Elementary Forms
41360,"though the motions may be the same, the sentiments expressed are",Elementary Forms
41360,"different and even opposed. Likewise, the ascetic rites certainly imply",Elementary Forms
41360,"privations, abstinences and mutilations, but ones which must be borne",Elementary Forms
41360,"with an impassive firmness and serenity. Here, on the contrary,",Elementary Forms
41360,"dejection, cries and tears are the rule. The ascetic tortures himself in",Elementary Forms
41360,"order to prove, in his own eyes and those of his fellows, that he is",Elementary Forms
41360,"above suffering. During mourning, men injure themselves to prove that",Elementary Forms
41360,"they suffer. By all these signs, the characteristic traits of the",Elementary Forms
41360,piacular rites are to be recognized.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But how are they to be explained?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One initial fact is constant: mourning is not the spontaneous expression,Elementary Forms
41360,"of individual emotions.[1258] If the relations weep, lament, mutilate",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves, it is not because they feel themselves personally affected",Elementary Forms
41360,"by the death of their kinsman. Of course, it may be that in certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular cases, the chagrin expressed is really felt.[1259] But it is",Elementary Forms
41360,more generally the case that there is no connection between the,Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments felt and the gestures made by the actors in the rite.[1260],Elementary Forms
41360,"If, at the very moment when the weepers seem the most overcome by their",Elementary Forms
41360,"grief, some one speaks to them of some temporal interest, it frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"happens that they change their features and tone at once, take on a",Elementary Forms
41360,laughing air and converse in the gayest fashion imaginable.[1261],Elementary Forms
41360,Mourning is not a natural movement of private feelings wounded by a,Elementary Forms
41360,"cruel loss; it is a duty imposed by the group. One weeps, not simply",Elementary Forms
41360,"because he is sad, but because he is forced to weep. It is a ritual",Elementary Forms
41360,"attitude which he is forced to adopt out of respect for custom, but",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is, in a large measure, independent of his affective state.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, this obligation is sanctioned by mythical or social penalties.",Elementary Forms
41360,"They believe, for example, that if a relative does not mourn as is",Elementary Forms
41360,"fitting, then the soul of the departed follows upon his steps and kills",Elementary Forms
41360,"him.[1262] In other cases, society does not leave it to the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces to punish the negligent; it intervenes itself, and reprimands the",Elementary Forms
41360,ritual faults. If a son-in-law does not render to his father-in-law the,Elementary Forms
41360,"funeral attentions which are due him, and if he does not make the",Elementary Forms
41360,"prescribed incisions, then his tribal fathers-in-law take his wife away",Elementary Forms
41360,"from him and give him another.[1263] Therefore, in order to square",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself with usage, a man sometimes forces tears to flow by artificial",Elementary Forms
41360,means.[1264],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Whence comes this obligation?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Ethnographers and sociologists are generally satisfied with the reply,Elementary Forms
41360,which the natives themselves give to this question. They say that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"dead wish to be lamented, that by refusing them the tribute of sorrow",Elementary Forms
41360,"which is their right, men offend them, and that the only way of",Elementary Forms
41360,preventing their anger is to conform to their will.[1265],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But this mythological interpretation merely modifies the terms of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"problem, without resolving it; it is still necessary to explain why the",Elementary Forms
41360,dead imperatively reclaim the mourning. It may be said that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,natural for men to wish to be mourned and regretted. But in making this,Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiment explain the complex system of rites which make up mourning, we",Elementary Forms
41360,attribute to the Australian affective exigencies of which the civilized,Elementary Forms
41360,man himself does not always give evidence. Let us admit--as is not,Elementary Forms
41360,evident _a priori_--that the idea of not being forgotten too readily is,Elementary Forms
41360,pleasing to a man who thinks of the future. It is still to be,Elementary Forms
41360,established that it has ever had enough importance in the minds of the,Elementary Forms
41360,living for one to attribute to the dead a state of mind proceeding,Elementary Forms
41360,almost entirely from this preoccupation. It seems especially improbable,Elementary Forms
41360,that such a sentiment could obsess and impassion men who are seldom,Elementary Forms
41360,accustomed to thinking beyond the present moment. So far is it from,Elementary Forms
41360,being a fact that the desire to survive in the memory of those who are,Elementary Forms
41360,"still alive is to be regarded as the origin of mourning, that we may",Elementary Forms
41360,"even ask ourselves whether it was not rather mourning itself which, when",Elementary Forms
41360,"once established, aroused the idea of and the taste for posthumous",Elementary Forms
41360,regrets.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The classic interpretation appears still more unsustainable when we know,Elementary Forms
41360,what the primitive mourning consists in. It is not made up merely of,Elementary Forms
41360,"pious regrets accorded to him who no longer is, but also of severe",Elementary Forms
41360,abstinences and cruel sacrifices. The rite does not merely demand that,Elementary Forms
41360,"one think of the deceased in a melancholy way, but also that he beat",Elementary Forms
41360,"himself, bruise himself, lacerate himself and burn himself. We have even",Elementary Forms
41360,seen that persons in mourning sometimes torture themselves to such a,Elementary Forms
41360,degree that they do not survive their wounds. What reason has the dead,Elementary Forms
41360,man for imposing such torments upon them? Such a cruelty on his part,Elementary Forms
41360,denotes something more than a desire not to be forgotten. If he is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"find pleasure in seeing his own suffer, it is necessary that he hate",Elementary Forms
41360,"them, that he be thirsty for their blood. This ferocity would",Elementary Forms
41360,undoubtedly appear natural to those for whom every spirit is necessarily,Elementary Forms
41360,an evil and redoubted power. But we know that there are spirits of every,Elementary Forms
41360,sort; how does it happen that the soul of the dead man is necessarily an,Elementary Forms
41360,"evil spirit? As long as the man is alive, he loves his relatives and",Elementary Forms
41360,exchanges services with them. Is it not strange that as soon as it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"freed from his body, his soul should instantly lay aside its former",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments and become an evil and tormenting genius? It is a general,Elementary Forms
41360,"rule that the dead man retains the personality of the living, and that",Elementary Forms
41360,"he has the same character, the same hates and the same affections. So",Elementary Forms
41360,this metamorphosis is not easily understandable by itself. It is true,Elementary Forms
41360,that the natives admit it implicitly when they explain the rite by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"exigencies of the dead man, but the question now before us is to know",Elementary Forms
41360,whence this conception came. Far from being capable of being regarded,Elementary Forms
41360,"as a truism, it is as obscure as the rite itself, and consequently",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot account for it.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Finally, even if we had found the reasons for this surprising",Elementary Forms
41360,"transformation, we would still have to explain why it is only temporary.",Elementary Forms
41360,For it does not last beyond the period of mourning; after the rites have,Elementary Forms
41360,"once been accomplished, the dead man becomes what he was when alive, an",Elementary Forms
41360,affectionate and devoted relation. He puts the new powers which he,Elementary Forms
41360,receives from his new condition at the service of his friends.[1266],Elementary Forms
41360,"Thenceforth, he is regarded as a good genius, always ready to aid those",Elementary Forms
41360,whom he was recently tormenting. Whence come these successive transfers?,Elementary Forms
41360,If the evil sentiments attributed to the soul come solely from the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is no longer in life, they should remain invariable, and if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"mourning is due to this, it should be interminable.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These mythical explanations express the idea which the native has of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rite, and not the rite itself. So we may set them aside and face the",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality which they translate, though disfiguring it in doing so. If",Elementary Forms
41360,"mourning differs from the other forms of the positive cult, there is one",Elementary Forms
41360,"feature in which it resembles them: it, too, is made up out of",Elementary Forms
41360,collective ceremonies which produce a state of effervescence among those,Elementary Forms
41360,who take part in them. The sentiments aroused are different; but the,Elementary Forms
41360,arousal is the same. So it is presumable that the explanation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"joyous rites is capable of being applied to the sad rites, on condition",Elementary Forms
41360,that the terms be transposed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When some one dies, the family group to which he belongs feels itself",Elementary Forms
41360,"lessened and, to react against this loss, it assembles. A common",Elementary Forms
41360,misfortune has the same effects as the approach of a happy event:,Elementary Forms
41360,collective sentiments are renewed which then lead men to seek one,Elementary Forms
41360,another and to assemble together. We have even seen this need for,Elementary Forms
41360,concentration affirm itself with a particular energy: they embrace one,Elementary Forms
41360,"another, put their arms round one another, and press as close as",Elementary Forms
41360,possible to one another. But the affective state in which the group then,Elementary Forms
41360,happens to be only reflects the circumstances through which it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"passing. Not only do the relatives, who are effected the most directly,",Elementary Forms
41360,"bring their own personal sorrow to the assembly, but the society",Elementary Forms
41360,"exercises a moral pressure over its members, to put their sentiments in",Elementary Forms
41360,harmony with the situation. To allow them to remain indifferent to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"blow which has fallen upon it and diminished it, would be equivalent to",Elementary Forms
41360,proclaiming that it does not hold the place in their hearts which is due,Elementary Forms
41360,it; it would be denying itself. A family which allows one of its,Elementary Forms
41360,members to die without being wept for shows by that very fact that it,Elementary Forms
41360,lacks moral unity and cohesion: it abdicates; it renounces its,Elementary Forms
41360,"existence. An individual in his turn, if he is strongly attached to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"society of which he is a member, feels that he is morally held to",Elementary Forms
41360,participating in its sorrows and joys; not to be interested in them,Elementary Forms
41360,would be equivalent to breaking the bonds uniting him to the group; it,Elementary Forms
41360,would be renouncing all desire for it and contradicting himself. When,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Christian, during the ceremonies commemorating the Passion, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Jew, on the anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem, fast and mortify",Elementary Forms
41360,"themselves, it is not in giving way to a sadness which they feel",Elementary Forms
41360,"spontaneously. Under these circumstances, the internal state of the",Elementary Forms
41360,believer is out of all proportion to the severe abstinences to which,Elementary Forms
41360,"they submit themselves. If he is sad, it is primarily because he",Elementary Forms
41360,"consents to being sad, and he consents to it in order to affirm his",Elementary Forms
41360,faith. The attitude of the Australian during mourning is to be explained,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the same way. If he weeps and groans, it is not merely to express an",Elementary Forms
41360,individual chagrin; it is to fulfil a duty of which the surrounding,Elementary Forms
41360,society does not fail to remind him.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have seen elsewhere how human sentiments are intensified when,Elementary Forms
41360,"affirmed collectively. Sorrow, like joy, becomes exalted and amplified",Elementary Forms
41360,"when leaping from mind to mind, and therefore expresses itself outwardly",Elementary Forms
41360,in the form of exuberant and violent movements. But these are no longer,Elementary Forms
41360,expressive of the joyful agitation which we observed before; they are,Elementary Forms
41360,shrieks and cries of pain. Each is carried along by the others; a,Elementary Forms
41360,veritable panic of sorrow results. When pain reaches this degree of,Elementary Forms
41360,"intensity, it is mixed with a sort of anger and exasperation. One feels",Elementary Forms
41360,"the need of breaking something, of destroying something. He takes this",Elementary Forms
41360,"out either upon himself or others. He beats himself, burns himself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"wounds himself or else he falls upon others to beat, burn and wound",Elementary Forms
41360,them. Thus it became the custom to give one's self up to the veritable,Elementary Forms
41360,orgies of tortures during mourning. It seems very probable that,Elementary Forms
41360,blood-revenge and head-hunting have their origin in this. If every death,Elementary Forms
41360,"is attributed to some magic charm, and for this reason it is believed",Elementary Forms
41360,"that the dead man ought to be avenged, it is because men must find a",Elementary Forms
41360,"victim at any price, upon whom the collective pain and anger may be",Elementary Forms
41360,discharged. Naturally this victim is sought outside the group; a,Elementary Forms
41360,stranger is a subject _minoris resistentiae_; as he is not protected by,Elementary Forms
41360,"the sentiments of sympathy inspired by a relative or neighbour, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing in him which subdues and neutralizes the evil and destructive,Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments aroused by the death. It is undoubtedly for this same reason,Elementary Forms
41360,that women serve more frequently than men as the passive objects of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"cruellest rites of mourning; since they have a smaller social value,",Elementary Forms
41360,they are more obviously designated as scapegoats.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We see that this explanation of mourning completely leaves aside all,Elementary Forms
41360,ideas of souls or spirits. The only forces which are really active are,Elementary Forms
41360,of a wholly impersonal nature: they are the emotions aroused in the,Elementary Forms
41360,group by the death of one of its members. But the primitive does not,Elementary Forms
41360,know the psychical mechanism from which these practices result. So when,Elementary Forms
41360,"he tries to account for them, he is obliged to forge a wholly different",Elementary Forms
41360,explanation. All he knows is that he must painfully mortify himself. As,Elementary Forms
41360,"every obligation suggests the notion of a will which obliges, he looks",Elementary Forms
41360,"about him to see whence this constraint which he feels may come. Now,",Elementary Forms
41360,"there is one moral power, of whose reality he is assured and which seems",Elementary Forms
41360,designated for this role: this is the soul which the death has,Elementary Forms
41360,liberated. For what could have a greater interest than it in the effects,Elementary Forms
41360,which its own death has on the living? So they imagine that if these,Elementary Forms
41360,"latter inflict an unnatural treatment upon themselves, it is to conform",Elementary Forms
41360,to its exigencies. It was thus that the idea of the soul must have,Elementary Forms
41360,"intervened at a later date into the mythology of mourning. But also,",Elementary Forms
41360,"since it is thus endowed with inhuman exigencies, it must be supposed",Elementary Forms
41360,"that in leaving the body which it animated, the soul lays aside every",Elementary Forms
41360,human sentiment. Hence the metamorphosis which makes a dreaded enemy out,Elementary Forms
41360,of the relative of yesterday. This transformation is not the origin of,Elementary Forms
41360,mourning; it is rather its consequence. It translates a change which has,Elementary Forms
41360,come over the affective state of the group: men do not weep for the dead,Elementary Forms
41360,because they fear them; they fear them because they weep for them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But this change of the affective state can only be a temporary one, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"while the ceremonies of mourning result from it, they also put an end to",Elementary Forms
41360,"it. Little by little, they neutralize the very causes which have given",Elementary Forms
41360,rise to them. The foundation of mourning is the impression of a loss,Elementary Forms
41360,which the group feels when it loses one of its members. But this very,Elementary Forms
41360,"impression results in bringing individuals together, in putting them",Elementary Forms
41360,"into closer relations with one another, in associating them all in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same mental state, and therefore in disengaging a sensation of comfort",Elementary Forms
41360,"which compensates the original loss.--Since they weep together, they",Elementary Forms
41360,"hold to one another and the group is not weakened, in spite of the blow",Elementary Forms
41360,which has fallen upon it. Of course they have only sad emotions in,Elementary Forms
41360,"common, but communicating in sorrow is still communicating, and every",Elementary Forms
41360,"communion of mind, in whatever form it may be made, raises the social",Elementary Forms
41360,vitality. The exceptional violence of the manifestations by which the,Elementary Forms
41360,common pain is necessarily and obligatorily expressed even testifies to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the fact that at this moment, the society is more alive and active than",Elementary Forms
41360,"ever. In fact, whenever the social sentiment is painfully wounded, it",Elementary Forms
41360,reacts with greater force than ordinarily: one never holds so closely to,Elementary Forms
41360,his family as when it has just suffered. This surplus energy effaces the,Elementary Forms
41360,"more completely the effects of the interruption which was felt at first,",Elementary Forms
41360,and thus dissipates the feeling of coldness which death always brings,Elementary Forms
41360,with it. The group feels its strength gradually returning to it; it,Elementary Forms
41360,"begins to hope and to live again. Presently one stops mourning, and he",Elementary Forms
41360,does so owing to the mourning itself. But as the idea formed of the soul,Elementary Forms
41360,"reflects the moral state of the society, this idea should change as this",Elementary Forms
41360,"state changes. When one is in the period of dejection and agony, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"represents the soul with the traits of an evil being, whose sole",Elementary Forms
41360,occupation is to persecute men. But when he feels himself confident and,Elementary Forms
41360,"secure once more, he must admit that it has retaken its former nature",Elementary Forms
41360,and its former sentiments of tenderness and solidarity. Thus we explain,Elementary Forms
41360,the very different ways in which it is conceived at different moments of,Elementary Forms
41360,its existence.[1267],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Not only do the rites of mourning determine certain of the secondary,Elementary Forms
41360,"characteristics attributed to the soul, but perhaps they are not foreign",Elementary Forms
41360,to the idea that it survives the body. If he is to understand the,Elementary Forms
41360,"practices to which he submits on the death of a parent, a man is obliged",Elementary Forms
41360,to believe that these are not an indifferent matter for the deceased.,Elementary Forms
41360,The shedding of blood which is practised so freely during mourning is a,Elementary Forms
41360,veritable sacrifice offered to the dead man.[1268] So something of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"dead man must survive, and as this is not the body, which is manifestly",Elementary Forms
41360,"immobile and decomposed, it can only be the soul. Of course it is",Elementary Forms
41360,impossible to say with any exactness what part these considerations have,Elementary Forms
41360,had in the origin of the idea of immortality. But it is probable that,Elementary Forms
41360,here the influence of the cult is the same as it is elsewhere. Rites are,Elementary Forms
41360,more easily explicable when one imagines that they are addressed to,Elementary Forms
41360,personal beings; so men have been induced to extend the influence of,Elementary Forms
41360,the mythical personalities in the religious life. In order to account,Elementary Forms
41360,"for mourning, they have prolonged the existence of the soul beyond the",Elementary Forms
41360,tomb. This is one more example of the way in which rites react upon,Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But death is not the only event which may disturb a community. Men have,Elementary Forms
41360,"many other occasions for being sorry and lamenting, so we might foresee",Elementary Forms
41360,that even the Australians would know and practise other piacular rites,Elementary Forms
41360,"besides mourning. However, it is a remarkable fact that only a small",Elementary Forms
41360,number of examples are to be found in the accounts of the observers.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One rite of this sort greatly resembles those which have just been,Elementary Forms
41360,"studied. It will be remembered that among the Arunta, each local group",Elementary Forms
41360,attributes exceptionally important virtues to its collection of,Elementary Forms
41360,"churinga: this is this collective palladium, upon whose fate the fate of",Elementary Forms
41360,the community itself is believed to depend. So when enemies or white men,Elementary Forms
41360,"succeed in stealing one of these religious treasures, this loss is",Elementary Forms
41360,considered a public calamity. This misfortune is the occasion of a rite,Elementary Forms
41360,having all the characteristics of mourning: men smear their bodies with,Elementary Forms
41360,"white pipe-clay and remain in camp, weeping and lamenting, during a",Elementary Forms
41360,period of two weeks.[1269] This is a new proof that mourning is,Elementary Forms
41360,"determined, not by the way in which the soul of the dead is conceived,",Elementary Forms
41360,"but by impersonal causes, by the moral state of the group. In fact, we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have here a rite which, in its structure, is indistinguishable from the",Elementary Forms
41360,"real mourning, but which is, nevertheless, independent of every notion",Elementary Forms
41360,of spirits or evil-working demons.[1270],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Another circumstance which gives occasion for ceremonies of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,nature is the distress in which the society finds itself after an,Elementary Forms
41360,"insufficient harvest. ""The natives who live in the vicinity of Lake",Elementary Forms
41360,"Eyre,"" says Eylmann, ""also seek to prevent an insufficiency of food by",Elementary Forms
41360,means of secret ceremonies. But many of the ritual practices observed in,Elementary Forms
41360,this region are to be distinguished from those which have been mentioned,Elementary Forms
41360,"already: it is not by symbolic dances, by imitative movements nor",Elementary Forms
41360,dazzling decorations that they try to act upon the religious powers or,Elementary Forms
41360,"the forces of nature, but by means of the suffering which individuals",Elementary Forms
41360,"inflict upon themselves. In the northern territories, it is by means of",Elementary Forms
41360,"tortures, such as prolonged fasts, vigils, dances persisted up to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"exhaustion of the dancers, and physical pains of every sort, that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"attempt to appease the powers which are ill-disposed towards men.""[1271]",Elementary Forms
41360,The torments to which the natives submit themselves for this purpose,Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes leave them in such a state of exhaustion that they are unable,Elementary Forms
41360,to follow the hunt for some days to come.[1272],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,These practices are employed especially for fighting against drought.,Elementary Forms
41360,This is because a scarcity of water results in a general want. To remedy,Elementary Forms
41360,"this evil, they have recourse to violent methods. One which is",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequently used is the extraction of a tooth. Among the Kaitish, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"example, they pull out an incisor from one man, and hang it on a",Elementary Forms
41360,"tree.[1273] Among the Dieri, the idea of rain is closely associated with",Elementary Forms
41360,that of bloody incisions made in the skin of the chest and arms.[1274],Elementary Forms
41360,"Among this same people, whenever the drought is very great, the great",Elementary Forms
41360,council assembles and summons the whole tribe. It is really a tribal,Elementary Forms
41360,event. Women are sent in every direction to notify men to assemble at a,Elementary Forms
41360,"given place and time. After they have assembled, they groan and cry in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"piercing voice about the miserable state of the land, and they beg the",Elementary Forms
41360,_Mura-mura_ (the mythical ancestors) to give them the power of making an,Elementary Forms
41360,"abundant rain fall.[1275] In the cases, which, by the way, are very",Elementary Forms
41360,"rare, when there has been an excessive rainfall, an analogous ceremony",Elementary Forms
41360,takes place to stop it. Old men then enter into a veritable,Elementary Forms
41360,"frenzy,[1276] while the cries uttered by the crowd are really painful to",Elementary Forms
41360,hear.[1277],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Spencer and Gillen describe, under the name of Intichiuma, a ceremony",Elementary Forms
41360,which may well have the same object and the same origin as the preceding,Elementary Forms
41360,ones: a physical torture is applied to make an animal species multiply.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Among the Urabunna, there is one clan whose totem is a variety of snake",Elementary Forms
41360,"called _wadnungadni_. This is how the chief of the clan proceeds, to",Elementary Forms
41360,make sure that these snakes may never be lacking. After having been,Elementary Forms
41360,"decorated, he kneels down on the ground, holding his arms straight out.",Elementary Forms
41360,"An assistant pinches the skin of his right arm between his fingers, and",Elementary Forms
41360,the officiant forces a pointed bone five inches long through the fold,Elementary Forms
41360,thus formed. This self-mutilation is believed to produce the desired,Elementary Forms
41360,result.[1278] An analogous rite is used among the Dieri to make the,Elementary Forms
41360,wild-hens lay: the operators pierce their scrotums.[1279] In certain of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the Lake Eyre tribes, men pierce their ears to make yams",Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce.[1280],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But these partial or total famines are not the only plagues which may,Elementary Forms
41360,fall upon a tribe. Other events happen more or less periodically which,Elementary Forms
41360,"menace, or seem to menace, the existence of the group. This is the case,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for example, with the southern lights. The Kurnai believe that this is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"fire lighted in the heavens by the great god Mungan-ngaua; therefore,",Elementary Forms
41360,"whenever they see it, they are afraid that it may spread to the earth",Elementary Forms
41360,"and devour them, so a great effervescence results in the camp. They",Elementary Forms
41360,"shake a withered hand, to which the Kurnai attribute various virtues,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and utter such cries as ""Send it away; do not let us be burned."" At the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, the old men order an exchange of wives, which always",Elementary Forms
41360,indicates a great excitement.[1281] The same sexual licence is mentioned,Elementary Forms
41360,"among the Wiimbaio whenever a plague appears imminent, and especially in",Elementary Forms
41360,times of an epidemic.[1282],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Under the influence of these ideas, mutilations and the shedding of",Elementary Forms
41360,blood are sometimes considered an efficient means of curing maladies. If,Elementary Forms
41360,"an accident happens to a child among the Dieri, his relations beat",Elementary Forms
41360,themselves on the head with clubs or boomerangs until the blood flows,Elementary Forms
41360,"down over their faces. They believe that by this process, they relieve",Elementary Forms
41360,"the child of the suffering.[1283] Elsewhere, they imagine that they can",Elementary Forms
41360,obtain the same end by means of a supplementary totemic ceremony.[1284],Elementary Forms
41360,We may connect with these the example already given of a ceremony,Elementary Forms
41360,celebrated specially to efface the effects of a ritual fault.[1285] Of,Elementary Forms
41360,course there are neither wounds nor blows nor physical suffering of any,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort in these two latter cases, yet the rite does not differ in nature",Elementary Forms
41360,from the others: the end sought is always the turning aside of an evil,Elementary Forms
41360,or the expiation of a fault by means of an extraordinary ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,prestation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Outside of mourning, such are the only cases of piacular rites which we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have succeeded in finding in Australia. To be sure, it is probable that",Elementary Forms
41360,"some have escaped us, while we may presume equally well that others have",Elementary Forms
41360,remained unperceived by the observers. But if those discovered up to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"present are few in number, it is probably because they do not hold a",Elementary Forms
41360,large place in the cult. We see how far primitive religions are from,Elementary Forms
41360,being the daughters of agony and fear from the fact that the rites,Elementary Forms
41360,translating these painful emotions are relatively rare. Of course this,Elementary Forms
41360,"is because the Australian, while leading a miserable existence as",Elementary Forms
41360,"compared with other more civilized peoples, demands so little of life",Elementary Forms
41360,that he is easily contented. All that he asks is that nature follow its,Elementary Forms
41360,"normal course, that the seasons succeed one another regularly, that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rain fall, at the ordinary time, in abundance and without excess. Now",Elementary Forms
41360,great disturbances in the cosmic order are always exceptional; thus it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is noticeable that the majority of the regular piacular rites, examples",Elementary Forms
41360,"of which we have given above, have been observed in the tribes of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"centre, where droughts are frequent and constitute veritable disasters.",Elementary Forms
41360,"It is still surprising, it is true, that piacular rites specially",Elementary Forms
41360,"destined to expiate sins, seem to be completely lacking. However, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian, like every other man, must commit ritual faults, which he",Elementary Forms
41360,has an interest in redeeming; so we may ask if the silence of the texts,Elementary Forms
41360,on this point may not be due to insufficient observation.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But howsoever few the facts which we have been able to gather may be,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are, nevertheless, instructive.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When we study piacular rites in the more advanced religions, where the",Elementary Forms
41360,"religious forces are individualized, they appear to be closely bound up",Elementary Forms
41360,with anthropomorphic conceptions. When the believer imposes privations,Elementary Forms
41360,"upon himself and submits himself to austerities, it is in order to",Elementary Forms
41360,disarm the malevolence attributed by him to certain of the sacred beings,Elementary Forms
41360,upon whom he thinks that he is dependent. To appease their hatred or,Elementary Forms
41360,"anger, he complies with their exigencies; he beats himself in order that",Elementary Forms
41360,he may not be beaten by them. So it seems as though these practices,Elementary Forms
41360,could not arise until after gods and spirits were conceived as moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"persons, capable of passions analogous to those of men. For this reason,",Elementary Forms
41360,Robertson Smith thought it possible to assign a relatively late date to,Elementary Forms
41360,"expiatory sacrifices, just as to sacrificial oblations. According to",Elementary Forms
41360,"him, the shedding of blood which characterizes these rites was at first",Elementary Forms
41360,a simple process of communion: men poured forth their blood upon the,Elementary Forms
41360,altar in order to strengthen the bonds uniting them to their god. The,Elementary Forms
41360,rite acquired a piacular and penal character only when its original,Elementary Forms
41360,significance was forgotten and when the new idea which was formed of,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred beings allowed men to attribute another function to it.[1286],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But as piacular rites are met with even in the Australian societies, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is impossible to assign them so late an origin. Moreover, all that we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have observed, with one single exception,[1287] are independent of all",Elementary Forms
41360,anthropomorphic conceptions: there is no question of either spirits or,Elementary Forms
41360,gods. Abstinences and effusions of blood stop famines and cure,Elementary Forms
41360,sicknesses directly and by themselves. No spiritual being introduces his,Elementary Forms
41360,action between the rite and the effect it is believed to produce. So,Elementary Forms
41360,mythical personalities intervened only at a late date. After the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mechanism of the ritual had once been established, they served to make",Elementary Forms
41360,"it more easily representable in the mind, but they are not conditions of",Elementary Forms
41360,its existence. It is for other reasons that it was founded; it is to,Elementary Forms
41360,another cause that it owes its efficacy.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It acts through the collective forces which it puts into play. Does a,Elementary Forms
41360,misfortune which menaces the group appear imminent? Then the group,Elementary Forms
41360,"unites, as in the case of mourning, and it is naturally an impression of",Elementary Forms
41360,"uneasiness and perplexity which dominates the assembled body. Now, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"always, the pooling of these sentiments results in intensifying them. By",Elementary Forms
41360,"affirming themselves, they exalt and impassion themselves and attain a",Elementary Forms
41360,degree of violence which is translated by the corresponding violence of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the gestures which express them. Just as at the death of a relative,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they utter terrible cries, fly into a passion and feel that they must",Elementary Forms
41360,"tear and destroy; it is to satisfy this need that they beat themselves,",Elementary Forms
41360,"wound themselves, and make their blood flow. When emotions have this",Elementary Forms
41360,"vivacity, they may well be painful, but they are not depressing; on the",Elementary Forms
41360,"contrary, they denote a state of effervescence which implies a",Elementary Forms
41360,"mobilization of all our active forces, and even a supply of external",Elementary Forms
41360,energies. It matters little that this exaltation was provoked by a sad,Elementary Forms
41360,"event, for it is real, notwithstanding, and does not differ specifically",Elementary Forms
41360,from what is observed in the happy feasts. Sometimes it is even made,Elementary Forms
41360,manifest by movements of the same nature: there is the same frenzy which,Elementary Forms
41360,"seizes the worshippers and the same tendency towards sexual debauches, a",Elementary Forms
41360,sure sign of great nervous over-excitement. Robertson Smith had already,Elementary Forms
41360,"noticed this curious influence of sad rites in the Semitic cults: ""in",Elementary Forms
41360,"evil times,"" he says, ""when men's thoughts were habitually sombre, they",Elementary Forms
41360,betook themselves to the physical excitement of religion as men now take,Elementary Forms
41360,refuge in wine.... And so in general when an act of Semitic worship,Elementary Forms
41360,"began with sorrow and lamentation--as in the mourning for Adonis, or the",Elementary Forms
41360,great atoning ceremonies which became common in later times--a swift,Elementary Forms
41360,"revulsion of feeling followed, and the gloomy part of the service was",Elementary Forms
41360,"presently succeeded by a burst of hilarious revelry.""[1288] In a word,",Elementary Forms
41360,even when religious ceremonies have a disquieting or saddening event as,Elementary Forms
41360,"their point of departure, they retain their stimulating power over the",Elementary Forms
41360,affective state of the group and individuals. By the mere fact that they,Elementary Forms
41360,"are collective, they raise the vital tone. When one feels life within",Elementary Forms
41360,him--whether it be in the form of painful irritation or happy,Elementary Forms
41360,enthusiasm--he does not believe in death; so he becomes reassured and,Elementary Forms
41360,"takes courage again, and subjectively, everything goes on as if the rite",Elementary Forms
41360,had really driven off the danger which was dreaded. This is how curing,Elementary Forms
41360,or preventive virtues come to be attributed to the movements which one,Elementary Forms
41360,"makes, to the cries uttered, to the blood shed and to the wounds",Elementary Forms
41360,inflicted upon one's self or others; and as these different tortures,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessarily make one suffer, suffering by itself is finally regarded as",Elementary Forms
41360,"a means of conjuring evil or curing sickness.[1289] Later, when the",Elementary Forms
41360,majority of the religious forces had taken the form of moral,Elementary Forms
41360,"personalities, the efficacy of these practices was explained by",Elementary Forms
41360,imagining that their object was to appease an evil-working or irritated,Elementary Forms
41360,god. But these conceptions only reflect the rite and the sentiments it,Elementary Forms
41360,"arouses; they are an interpretation of it, not its determining cause.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"A negligence of the ritual acts in the same way. It, too, is a menace",Elementary Forms
41360,for the group; it touches it in its moral existence for it touches it in,Elementary Forms
41360,its beliefs. But if the anger which it causes is affirmed ostensibly and,Elementary Forms
41360,"energetically, it compensates the evil which it has caused. For if it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"acutely felt by all, it is because the infraction committed is an",Elementary Forms
41360,exception and the common faith remains entire. So the moral unity of the,Elementary Forms
41360,group is not endangered. Now the penalty inflicted as an expiation is,Elementary Forms
41360,"only a manifestation of the public anger, the material proof of its",Elementary Forms
41360,unanimity. So it really does have the healing effect attributed to it.,Elementary Forms
41360,"At bottom, the sentiment which is at the root of the real expiatory",Elementary Forms
41360,rites does not differ in nature from that which we have found at the,Elementary Forms
41360,basis of the other piacular rites: it is a sort of irritated sorrow,Elementary Forms
41360,which tends to manifest itself by acts of destruction. Sometimes it is,Elementary Forms
41360,assuaged to the detriment of him who feels it; sometimes it is at the,Elementary Forms
41360,"expense of some foreign third party. But in either case, the psychic",Elementary Forms
41360,mechanism is essentially the same.[1290],Elementary Forms

41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,One of the greatest services which Robertson Smith has rendered to the,Elementary Forms
41360,science of religions is to have pointed out the ambiguity of the notion,Elementary Forms
41360,of sacredness.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Religious forces are of two sorts. Some are beneficent, guardians of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"physical and moral order, dispensers of life and health and all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"qualities which men esteem: this is the case with the totemic principle,",Elementary Forms
41360,"spread out in the whole species, the mythical ancestor, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"animal-protector, the civilizing heroes and the tutelar gods of every",Elementary Forms
41360,kind and degree. It matters little whether they are conceived as,Elementary Forms
41360,distinct personalities or as diffused energies; under either form they,Elementary Forms
41360,fulfil the same function and affect the minds of the believers in the,Elementary Forms
41360,same way: the respect which they inspire is mixed with love and,Elementary Forms
41360,gratitude. The things and the persons which are normally connected with,Elementary Forms
41360,them participate in the same sentiments and the same character: these,Elementary Forms
41360,"are holy things and persons. Such are the spots consecrated to the cult,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the objects which serve in the regular rites, the priests, the ascetics,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc.--On the other hand, there are evil and impure powers, productive of",Elementary Forms
41360,"disorders, causes of death and sickness, instigators of sacrilege. The",Elementary Forms
41360,only sentiments which men have for them are a fear into which horror,Elementary Forms
41360,generally enters. Such are the forces upon which and by which the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sorcerer acts, those which arise from corpses or the menstrual blood,",Elementary Forms
41360,"those freed by every profanation of sacred things, etc. The spirits of",Elementary Forms
41360,the dead and malign genii of every sort are their personified forms.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Between these two categories of forces and beings, the contrast is as",Elementary Forms
41360,complete as possible and even goes into the most radical antagonism. The,Elementary Forms
41360,good and salutary powers repel to a distance these others which deny and,Elementary Forms
41360,contradict them. Therefore the former are forbidden to the latter: any,Elementary Forms
41360,contact between them is considered the worst of profanations. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,the typical form of those interdicts between sacred things of different,Elementary Forms
41360,"species, the existence of which we have already pointed out.[1291] Women",Elementary Forms
41360,"during menstruation, and especially at its beginning, are impure; so at",Elementary Forms
41360,this moment they are rigorously sequestered; men may have no relations,Elementary Forms
41360,with them.[1292] Bull-roarers and churinga never come near a dead,Elementary Forms
41360,man.[1293] A sacrilegious person is excluded from the society of the,Elementary Forms
41360,faithful; access to the cult is forbidden him. Thus the whole religious,Elementary Forms
41360,life gravitates about two contrary poles between which there is the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"opposition as between the pure and the impure, the saint and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sacrilegious, the divine and the diabolic.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But while these two aspects of the religious life oppose one another,",Elementary Forms
41360,"there is a close kinship between them. In the first place, both have the",Elementary Forms
41360,same relation towards profane beings: these must abstain from all,Elementary Forms
41360,contact with impure things just as from the most holy things. The former,Elementary Forms
41360,are no less forbidden than the latter: they are withdrawn from,Elementary Forms
41360,circulation alike. This shows that they too are sacred. Of course the,Elementary Forms
41360,"sentiments inspired by the two are not identical: respect is one thing,",Elementary Forms
41360,"disgust and horror another. Yet, if the gestures are to be the same in",Elementary Forms
41360,"both cases, the sentiments expressed must not differ in nature. And, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, there is a horror in religious respect, especially when it is very",Elementary Forms
41360,"intense, while the fear inspired by malign powers is generally not",Elementary Forms
41360,without a certain reverential character. The shades by which these two,Elementary Forms
41360,attitudes are differentiated are even so slight sometimes that it is not,Elementary Forms
41360,always easy to say which state of mind the believers actually happen to,Elementary Forms
41360,"be in. Among certain Semitic peoples, pork was forbidden, but it was not",Elementary Forms
41360,always known exactly whether this was because it was a pure or an impure,Elementary Forms
41360,thing[1294] and the same may be said of a very large number of,Elementary Forms
41360,alimentary interdictions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But there is more to be said; it very frequently happens that an impure,Elementary Forms
41360,"thing or an evil power becomes a holy thing or a guardian power, without",Elementary Forms
41360,"changing its nature, through a simple modification of external",Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances. We have seen how the soul of a dead man, which is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"dreaded principle at first, is transformed into a protecting genius as",Elementary Forms
41360,"soon as the mourning is finished. Likewise, the corpse, which begins by",Elementary Forms
41360,"inspiring terror and aversion, is later regarded as a venerated relic:",Elementary Forms
41360,"funeral anthropophagy, which is frequently practised in the Australian",Elementary Forms
41360,"societies, is a proof of this transformation.[1295] The totemic animal",Elementary Forms
41360,is the pre-eminently sacred being; but for him who eats its flesh,Elementary Forms
41360,"unduly, it is a cause of death. In a general way, the sacrilegious",Elementary Forms
41360,person is merely a profane one who has been infected with a benevolent,Elementary Forms
41360,religious force. This changes its nature in changing its habitat; it,Elementary Forms
41360,defiles rather than sanctifies.[1296] The blood issuing from the,Elementary Forms
41360,"genital organs of a woman, though it is evidently as impure as that of",Elementary Forms
41360,"menstruation, is frequently used as a remedy against sickness.[1297] The",Elementary Forms
41360,"victim immolated in expiatory sacrifices is charged with impurities, for",Elementary Forms
41360,"they have concentrated upon it the sins which were to be expiated. Yet,",Elementary Forms
41360,"after it has been slaughtered, its flesh and blood are employed for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"most pious uses.[1298] On the contrary, though the communion is",Elementary Forms
41360,"generally a religious operation whose normal function is to consecrate,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it sometimes produces the effects of a sacrilege. In certain cases, the",Elementary Forms
41360,persons who have communicated are forced to flee from one another as,Elementary Forms
41360,from men infected with a plague. One would say that they have become a,Elementary Forms
41360,source of dangerous contamination for one another: the sacred bond which,Elementary Forms
41360,unites them also separates them. Examples of this sort of communion are,Elementary Forms
41360,numerous in Australia. One of the most typical has been observed among,Elementary Forms
41360,the Narrinyeri and the neighbouring tribes. When an infant arrives in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the world, its parents carefully preserve its umbilical cord, which is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to conceal a part of its soul. Two persons who exchange the,Elementary Forms
41360,cords thus preserved communicate together by the very act of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"exchange, for it is as though they exchanged their souls. But, at the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same time, they are forbidden to touch or speak to or even to see one",Elementary Forms
41360,another. It is just as though they were each an object of horror for the,Elementary Forms
41360,other.[1299],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"So the pure and the impure are not two separate classes, but two",Elementary Forms
41360,"varieties of the same class, which includes all sacred things. There are",Elementary Forms
41360,"two sorts of sacredness, the propitious and the unpropitious, and not",Elementary Forms
41360,"only is there no break of continuity between these two opposed forms,",Elementary Forms
41360,but also one object may pass from the one to the other without changing,Elementary Forms
41360,"its nature. The pure is made out of the impure, and reciprocally. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,in the possibility of these transmutations that the ambiguity of the,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred consists.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But even if Robertson Smith did have an active sentiment of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"ambiguity, he never gave it an express explanation. He confined himself",Elementary Forms
41360,"to remarking that, as all religious forces are indistinctly intense and",Elementary Forms
41360,"contagious, it is wise not to approach them except with respectful",Elementary Forms
41360,"precautions, no matter what direction their action may be exercised in.",Elementary Forms
41360,It seemed to him that he could thus account for the air of kinship which,Elementary Forms
41360,"they all present, in spite of the contrasts which oppose them",Elementary Forms
41360,otherwise. But the question was only put off; it still remains to be,Elementary Forms
41360,shown how it comes that the powers of evil have the same intensity and,Elementary Forms
41360,"contagiousness as the others. In other words, how does it happen that",Elementary Forms
41360,"they, too, are of a religious nature? Also, the energy and force of",Elementary Forms
41360,"expansion which they have in common do not enable us to understand how,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in spite of the conflict which divides them, they may be transformed",Elementary Forms
41360,into one another or substituted for each other in their respective,Elementary Forms
41360,"functions, and how the pure may contaminate while the impure sometimes",Elementary Forms
41360,serves to sanctify.[1300],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The explanation of piacular rites which we have proposed enables us to,Elementary Forms
41360,reply to this double question.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We have seen, in fact, that the evil powers are the product of these",Elementary Forms
41360,rites and symbolize them. When a society is going through circumstances,Elementary Forms
41360,"which sadden, perplex or irritate it, it exercises a pressure over its",Elementary Forms
41360,"members, to make them bear witness, by significant acts, to their",Elementary Forms
41360,"sorrow, perplexity or anger. It imposes upon them the duty of weeping,",Elementary Forms
41360,"groaning or inflicting wounds upon themselves or others, for these",Elementary Forms
41360,"collective manifestations, and the moral communion which they show and",Elementary Forms
41360,"strengthen, restore to the group the energy which circumstances threaten",Elementary Forms
41360,"to take away from it, and thus they enable it to become settled. This is",Elementary Forms
41360,the experience which men interpret when they imagine that outside them,Elementary Forms
41360,"there are evil beings whose hostility, whether constitutional or",Elementary Forms
41360,"temporary, can be appeased only by human suffering. These beings are",Elementary Forms
41360,nothing other than collective states objectified; they are society,Elementary Forms
41360,itself seen under one of its aspects. But we also know that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"benevolent powers are constituted in the same way; they, too, result",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the collective life and express it; they, too, represent the",Elementary Forms
41360,"society, but seen from a very different attitude, to wit, at the moment",Elementary Forms
41360,when it confidently affirms itself and ardently presses on towards the,Elementary Forms
41360,realization of the ends which it pursues. Since these two sorts of,Elementary Forms
41360,"forces have a common origin, it is not at all surprising that, though",Elementary Forms
41360,"facing in opposite directions, they should have the same nature, that",Elementary Forms
41360,they are equally intense and contagious and consequently forbidden and,Elementary Forms
41360,sacred.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,From this we are able to understand how they change into one another.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Since they reflect the abjective state in which the group happens to be,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is enough that this state change for their character to change. After,Elementary Forms
41360,"the mourning is over, the domestic group is re-calmed by the mourning",Elementary Forms
41360,itself; it regains confidence; the painful pressure which they felt,Elementary Forms
41360,exercised over them is relieved; they feel more at their ease. So it,Elementary Forms
41360,seems to them as though the spirit of the deceased had laid aside its,Elementary Forms
41360,hostile sentiments and become a benevolent protector. The other,Elementary Forms
41360,"transmutations, examples of which we have cited, are to be explained in",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same way. As we have already shown, the sanctity of a thing is due",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the collective sentiment of which it is the object. If, in violation",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the interdicts which isolate it, it comes in contact with a profane",Elementary Forms
41360,"person, then this same sentiment will spread contagiously to this latter",Elementary Forms
41360,"and imprint a special character upon him. But in spreading, it comes",Elementary Forms
41360,into a very different state from the one it was in at first. Offended,Elementary Forms
41360,and irritated by the profanation implied in this abusive and unnatural,Elementary Forms
41360,"extension, it becomes aggressive and inclined to destructive violences:",Elementary Forms
41360,it tends to avenge itself for the offence suffered. Therefore the,Elementary Forms
41360,infected subject seems to be filled with a mighty and harmful force,Elementary Forms
41360,which menaces all that approaches him; it is as though he were marked,Elementary Forms
41360,with a stain or blemish. Yet the cause of this blemish is the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"psychic state which, in other circumstances, consecrates and sanctifies.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But if the anger thus aroused is satisfied by an expiatory rite, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"subsides, alleviated; the offended sentiment is appeased and returns to",Elementary Forms
41360,its original state. So it acts once more as it acted in the beginning;,Elementary Forms
41360,"instead of contaminating, it sanctifies. As it continues to infect the",Elementary Forms
41360,"object to which it is attached, this could never become profane and",Elementary Forms
41360,religiously indifferent again. But the direction of the religious force,Elementary Forms
41360,"with which it seems to be filled is inverted: from being impure, it has",Elementary Forms
41360,become pure and an instrument of purification.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In resume, the two poles of the religious life correspond to the two",Elementary Forms
41360,opposed states through which all social life passes. Between the,Elementary Forms
41360,propitiously sacred and the unpropitiously sacred there is the same,Elementary Forms
41360,contrast as between the states of collective well-being and ill-being.,Elementary Forms
41360,"But since both are equally collective, there is, between the",Elementary Forms
41360,"mythological constructions symbolizing them, an intimate kinship of",Elementary Forms
41360,nature. The sentiments held in common vary from extreme dejection to,Elementary Forms
41360,"extreme joy, from painful irritation to ecstatic enthusiasm; but, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"any case, there is a communion of minds and a mutual comfort resulting",Elementary Forms
41360,from this communion. The fundamental process is always the same; only,Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances colour it differently. So, at bottom, it is the unity and",Elementary Forms
41360,the diversity of social life which make the simultaneous unity and,Elementary Forms
41360,diversity of sacred beings and things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This ambiguity, moreover, is not peculiar to the idea of sacredness",Elementary Forms
41360,alone; something of this characteristic has been found in all the rites,Elementary Forms
41360,which we have been studying. Of course it was essential to distinguish,Elementary Forms
41360,them; to confuse them would have been to misunderstand the multiple,Elementary Forms
41360,"aspects of the religious life. But, on the other hand, howsoever",Elementary Forms
41360,"different they may be, there is no break of continuity between them.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Quite on the contrary, they overlap one another and may even replace",Elementary Forms
41360,each other mutually. We have already shown how the rites of oblation and,Elementary Forms
41360,"communion, the imitative rites and the commemorative rites frequently",Elementary Forms
41360,"fulfil the same function. One might imagine that the negative cult, at",Elementary Forms
41360,"least, would be more sharply separated from the positive cult; yet we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have seen that the former may produce positive effects, identical with",Elementary Forms
41360,"those produced by the latter. The same results are obtained by fasts,",Elementary Forms
41360,"abstinences and self-mutilations as by communions, oblations and",Elementary Forms
41360,"commemorations. Inversely, offerings and sacrifices imply privations and",Elementary Forms
41360,renunciations of every sort. The continuity between ascetic and piacular,Elementary Forms
41360,"rites is even more apparent: both are made up of sufferings, accepted or",Elementary Forms
41360,"undergone, to which an analogous efficacy is attributed. Thus the",Elementary Forms
41360,"practices, like the beliefs, are not arranged in two separate classes.",Elementary Forms
41360,Howsoever complex the outward manifestations of the religious life may,Elementary Forms
41360,"be, at bottom it is one and simple. It responds everywhere to one and",Elementary Forms
41360,"the same need, and is everywhere derived from one and the same mental",Elementary Forms
41360,"state. In all its forms, its object is to raise man above himself and to",Elementary Forms
41360,"make him lead a life superior to that which he would lead, if he",Elementary Forms
41360,followed only his own individual whims: beliefs express this life in,Elementary Forms
41360,representations; rites organize it and regulate its working.,Elementary Forms

41360,CONCLUSION,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,At the beginning of this work we announced that the religion whose study,Elementary Forms
41360,we were taking up contained within it the most characteristic elements,Elementary Forms
41360,of the religious life. The exactness of this proposition may now be,Elementary Forms
41360,"verified. Howsoever simple the system which we have studied may be, we",Elementary Forms
41360,have found within it all the great ideas and the principal ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,attitudes which are at the basis of even the most advanced religions:,Elementary Forms
41360,"the division of things into sacred and profane, the notions of the soul,",Elementary Forms
41360,"of spirits, of mythical personalities, and of a national and even",Elementary Forms
41360,"international divinity, a negative cult with ascetic practices which are",Elementary Forms
41360,"its exaggerated form, rites of oblation and communion, imitative rites,",Elementary Forms
41360,commemorative rites and expiatory rites; nothing essential is lacking.,Elementary Forms
41360,We are thus in a position to hope that the results at which we have,Elementary Forms
41360,"arrived are not peculiar to totemism alone, but can aid us in an",Elementary Forms
41360,understanding of what religion in general is.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It may be objected that one single religion, whatever its field of",Elementary Forms
41360,"extension may be, is too narrow a base for such an induction. We have",Elementary Forms
41360,not dreamed for a moment of ignoring the fact that an extended,Elementary Forms
41360,"verification may add to the authority of a theory, but it is equally",Elementary Forms
41360,"true that when a law has been proven by one well-made experiment, this",Elementary Forms
41360,proof is valid universally. If in one single case a scientist succeeded,Elementary Forms
41360,in finding out the secret of the life of even the most protoplasmic,Elementary Forms
41360,"creature that can be imagined, the truths thus obtained would be",Elementary Forms
41360,"applicable to all living beings, even the most advanced. Then if, in our",Elementary Forms
41360,"studies of these very humble societies, we have really succeeded in",Elementary Forms
41360,discovering some of the elements out of which the most fundamental,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious notions are made up, there is no reason for not extending the",Elementary Forms
41360,"most general results of our researches to other religions. In fact, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is inconceivable that the same effect may be due now to one cause, now",Elementary Forms
41360,"to another, according to the circumstances, unless the two causes are at",Elementary Forms
41360,bottom only one. A single idea cannot express one reality here and,Elementary Forms
41360,"another one there, unless the duality is only apparent. If among certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"peoples the ideas of sacredness, the soul and God are to be explained",Elementary Forms
41360,"sociologically, it should be presumed scientifically that, in principle,",Elementary Forms
41360,the same explanation is valid for all the peoples among whom these same,Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas are found with the same essential characteristics. Therefore,",Elementary Forms
41360,"supposing that we have not been deceived, certain at least of our",Elementary Forms
41360,conclusions can be legitimately generalized. The moment has come to,Elementary Forms
41360,"disengage these. And an induction of this sort, having at its foundation",Elementary Forms
41360,"a clearly defined experiment, is less adventurous than many summary",Elementary Forms
41360,"generalizations which, while attempting to reach the essence of religion",Elementary Forms
41360,"at once, without resting upon the careful analysis of any religion in",Elementary Forms
41360,"particular, greatly risk losing themselves in space.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,I,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The theorists who have undertaken to explain religion in rational terms,Elementary Forms
41360,"have generally seen in it before all else a system of ideas,",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding to some determined object. This object has been conceived,Elementary Forms
41360,"in a multitude of ways: nature, the infinite, the unknowable, the ideal,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc.; but these differences matter but little. In any case, it was the",Elementary Forms
41360,conceptions and beliefs which were considered as the essential elements,Elementary Forms
41360,"of religion. As for the rites, from this point of view they appear to be",Elementary Forms
41360,"only an external translation, contingent and material, of these internal",Elementary Forms
41360,states which alone pass as having any intrinsic value. This conception,Elementary Forms
41360,is so commonly held that generally the disputes of which religion is the,Elementary Forms
41360,theme turn about the question whether it can conciliate itself with,Elementary Forms
41360,"science or not, that is to say, whether or not there is a place beside",Elementary Forms
41360,our scientific knowledge for another form of thought which would be,Elementary Forms
41360,specifically religious.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But the believers, the men who lead the religious life and have a direct",Elementary Forms
41360,"sensation of what it really is, object to this way of regarding it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"saying that it does not correspond to their daily experience. In fact,",Elementary Forms
41360,"they feel that the real function of religion is not to make us think, to",Elementary Forms
41360,"enrich our knowledge, nor to add to the conceptions which we owe to",Elementary Forms
41360,"science others of another origin and another character, but rather, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to make us act, to aid us to live. The believer who has communicated",Elementary Forms
41360,with his god is not merely a man who sees new truths of which the,Elementary Forms
41360,unbeliever is ignorant; he is a man who is _stronger_. He feels within,Elementary Forms
41360,"him more force, either to endure the trials of existence, or to conquer",Elementary Forms
41360,"them. It is as though he were raised above the miseries of the world,",Elementary Forms
41360,because he is raised above his condition as a mere man; he believes that,Elementary Forms
41360,"he is saved from evil, under whatever form he may conceive this evil.",Elementary Forms
41360,The first article in every creed is the belief in salvation by faith.,Elementary Forms
41360,But it is hard to see how a mere idea could have this efficacy. An idea,Elementary Forms
41360,is in reality only a part of ourselves; then how could it confer upon us,Elementary Forms
41360,powers superior to those which we have of our own nature? Howsoever rich,Elementary Forms
41360,"it might be in affective virtues, it could add nothing to our natural",Elementary Forms
41360,vitality; for it could only release the motive powers which are within,Elementary Forms
41360,"us, neither creating them nor increasing them. From the mere fact that",Elementary Forms
41360,"we consider an object worthy of being loved and sought after, it does",Elementary Forms
41360,not follow that we feel ourselves stronger afterwards; it is also,Elementary Forms
41360,necessary that this object set free energies superior to these which we,Elementary Forms
41360,ordinarily have at our command and also that we have some means of,Elementary Forms
41360,making these enter into us and unite themselves to our interior lives.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Now for that, it is not enough that we think of them; it is also",Elementary Forms
41360,"indispensable that we place ourselves within their sphere of action, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"that we set ourselves where we may best feel their influence; in a word,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is necessary that we act, and that we repeat the acts thus necessary",Elementary Forms
41360,every time we feel the need of renewing their effects. From this point,Elementary Forms
41360,"of view, it is readily seen how that group of regularly repeated acts",Elementary Forms
41360,"which form the cult get their importance. In fact, whoever has really",Elementary Forms
41360,practised a religion knows very well that it is the cult which gives,Elementary Forms
41360,"rise to these impressions of joy, of interior peace, of serenity, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"enthusiasm which are, for the believer, an experimental proof of his",Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs. The cult is not simply a system of signs by which the faith is,Elementary Forms
41360,outwardly translated; it is a collection of the means by which this is,Elementary Forms
41360,created and recreated periodically. Whether it consists in material acts,Elementary Forms
41360,"or mental operations, it is always this which is efficacious.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Our entire study rests upon this postulate that the unanimous sentiment,Elementary Forms
41360,of the believers of all times cannot be purely illusory. Together with a,Elementary Forms
41360,recent apologist of the faith[1301] we admit that these religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"beliefs rest upon a specific experience whose demonstrative value is, in",Elementary Forms
41360,"one sense, not one bit inferior to that of scientific experiments,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though different from them. We, too, think that ""a tree is known by its",Elementary Forms
41360,"fruits,""[1302] and that fertility is the best proof of what the roots",Elementary Forms
41360,"are worth. But from the fact that a ""religious experience,"" if we choose",Elementary Forms
41360,"to call it this, does exist and that it has a certain foundation--and,",Elementary Forms
41360,"by the way, is there any experience which has none?--it does not follow",Elementary Forms
41360,that the reality which is its foundation conforms objectively to the,Elementary Forms
41360,idea which believers have of it. The very fact that the fashion in which,Elementary Forms
41360,it has been conceived has varied infinitely in different times is enough,Elementary Forms
41360,to prove that none of these conceptions express it adequately. If a,Elementary Forms
41360,scientist states it as an axiom that the sensations of heat and light,Elementary Forms
41360,"which we feel correspond to some objective cause, he does not conclude",Elementary Forms
41360,"that this is what it appears to the senses to be. Likewise, even if the",Elementary Forms
41360,"impressions which the faithful feel are not imaginary, still they are in",Elementary Forms
41360,no way privileged intuitions; there is no reason for believing that they,Elementary Forms
41360,inform us better upon the nature of their object than do ordinary,Elementary Forms
41360,sensations upon the nature of bodies and their properties. In order to,Elementary Forms
41360,"discover what this object consists of, we must submit them to an",Elementary Forms
41360,examination and elaboration analogous to that which has substituted for,Elementary Forms
41360,the sensuous idea of the world another which is scientific and,Elementary Forms
41360,conceptual.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"This is precisely what we have tried to do, and we have seen that this",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality, which mythologies have represented under so many different",Elementary Forms
41360,"forms, but which is the universal and eternal objective cause of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"sensations _sui generis_ out of which religious experience is made, is",Elementary Forms
41360,society. We have shown what moral forces it develops and how it awakens,Elementary Forms
41360,"this sentiment of a refuge, of a shield and of a guardian support which",Elementary Forms
41360,attaches the believer to his cult. It is that which raises him outside,Elementary Forms
41360,himself; it is even that which made him. For that which makes a man is,Elementary Forms
41360,the totality of the intellectual property which constitutes,Elementary Forms
41360,"civilization, and civilization is the work of society. Thus is explained",Elementary Forms
41360,"the preponderating role of the cult in all religions, whichever they may",Elementary Forms
41360,be. This is because society cannot make its influence felt unless it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"in action, and it is not in action unless the individuals who compose it",Elementary Forms
41360,are assembled together and act in common. It is by common action that it,Elementary Forms
41360,takes consciousness of itself and realizes its position; it is before,Elementary Forms
41360,all else an active co-operation. The collective ideas and sentiments are,Elementary Forms
41360,even possible only owing to these exterior movements which symbolize,Elementary Forms
41360,"them, as we have established.[1303] Then it is action which dominates",Elementary Forms
41360,"the religious life, because of the mere fact that it is society which is",Elementary Forms
41360,its source.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,In addition to all the reasons which have been given to justify this,Elementary Forms
41360,"conception, a final one may be added here, which is the result of our",Elementary Forms
41360,"whole work. As we have progressed, we have established the fact that the",Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental categories of thought, and consequently of science, are of",Elementary Forms
41360,religious origin. We have seen that the same is true for magic and,Elementary Forms
41360,consequently for the different processes which have issued from it. On,Elementary Forms
41360,"the other hand, it has long been known that up until a relatively",Elementary Forms
41360,"advanced moment of evolution, moral and legal rules have been",Elementary Forms
41360,"indistinguishable from ritual prescriptions. In summing up, then, it may",Elementary Forms
41360,be said that nearly all the great social institutions have been born in,Elementary Forms
41360,religion.[1304] Now in order that these principal aspects of the,Elementary Forms
41360,collective life may have commenced by being only varied aspects of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious life, it is obviously necessary that the religious life be the",Elementary Forms
41360,"eminent form and, as it were, the concentrated expression of the whole",Elementary Forms
41360,collective life. If religion has given birth to all that is essential in,Elementary Forms
41360,"society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Religious forces are therefore human forces, moral forces. It is true",Elementary Forms
41360,that since collective sentiments can become conscious of themselves only,Elementary Forms
41360,"by fixing themselves upon external objects, they have not been able to",Elementary Forms
41360,take form without adopting some of their characteristics from other,Elementary Forms
41360,things: they have thus acquired a sort of physical nature; in this way,Elementary Forms
41360,"they have come to mix themselves with the life of the material world,",Elementary Forms
41360,and then have considered themselves capable of explaining what passes,Elementary Forms
41360,there. But when they are considered only from this point of view and in,Elementary Forms
41360,"this role, only their most superficial aspect is seen. In reality, the",Elementary Forms
41360,essential elements of which these collective sentiments are made have,Elementary Forms
41360,been borrowed by the understanding. It ordinarily seems that they should,Elementary Forms
41360,have a human character only when they are conceived under human,Elementary Forms
41360,forms;[1305] but even the most impersonal and the most anonymous are,Elementary Forms
41360,nothing else than objectified sentiments.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is only by regarding religion from this angle that it is possible to,Elementary Forms
41360,"see its real significance. If we stick closely to appearances, rites",Elementary Forms
41360,"often give the effect of purely manual operations: they are anointings,",Elementary Forms
41360,"washings, meals. To consecrate something, it is put in contact with a",Elementary Forms
41360,"source of religious energy, just as to-day a body is put in contact with",Elementary Forms
41360,a source of heat or electricity to warm or electrize it; the two,Elementary Forms
41360,"processes employed are not essentially different. Thus understood,",Elementary Forms
41360,religious technique seems to be a sort of mystic mechanics. But these,Elementary Forms
41360,material man[oe]uvres are only the external envelope under which the,Elementary Forms
41360,"mental operations are hidden. Finally, there is no question of",Elementary Forms
41360,"exercising a physical constraint upon blind and, incidentally, imaginary",Elementary Forms
41360,"forces, but rather of reaching individual consciousnesses, of giving",Elementary Forms
41360,them a direction and of disciplining them. It is sometimes said that,Elementary Forms
41360,inferior religions are materialistic. Such an expression is inexact. All,Elementary Forms
41360,"religions, even the crudest, are in a sense spiritualistic: for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"powers they put in play are before all spiritual, and also their",Elementary Forms
41360,principal object is to act upon the moral life. Thus it is seen that,Elementary Forms
41360,whatever has been done in the name of religion cannot have been done in,Elementary Forms
41360,"vain: for it is necessarily the society that did it, and it is humanity",Elementary Forms
41360,that has reaped the fruits.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But, it is said, what society is it that has thus made the basis of",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion? Is it the real society, such as it is and acts before our very",Elementary Forms
41360,"eyes, with the legal and moral organization which it has laboriously",Elementary Forms
41360,fashioned during the course of history? This is full of defects and,Elementary Forms
41360,"imperfections. In it, evil goes beside the good, injustice often reigns",Elementary Forms
41360,"supreme, and the truth is often obscured by error. How could anything so",Elementary Forms
41360,"crudely organized inspire the sentiments of love, the ardent enthusiasm",Elementary Forms
41360,and the spirit of abnegation which all religions claim of their,Elementary Forms
41360,followers? These perfect beings which are gods could not have taken,Elementary Forms
41360,"their traits from so mediocre, and sometimes even so base a reality.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But, on the other hand, does someone think of a perfect society, where",Elementary Forms
41360,"justice and truth would be sovereign, and from which evil in all its",Elementary Forms
41360,forms would be banished for ever? No one would deny that this is in,Elementary Forms
41360,"close relations with the religious sentiment; for, they would say, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,towards the realization of this that all religions strive. But that,Elementary Forms
41360,"society is not an empirical fact, definite and observable; it is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"fancy, a dream with which men have lightened their sufferings, but in",Elementary Forms
41360,which they have never really lived. It is merely an idea which comes to,Elementary Forms
41360,"express our more or less obscure aspirations towards the good, the",Elementary Forms
41360,beautiful and the ideal. Now these aspirations have their roots in us;,Elementary Forms
41360,they come from the very depths of our being; then there is nothing,Elementary Forms
41360,"outside of us which can account for them. Moreover, they are already",Elementary Forms
41360,religious in themselves; thus it would seem that the ideal society,Elementary Forms
41360,"presupposes religion, far from being able to explain it.[1306]",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But, in the first place, things are arbitrarily simplified when religion",Elementary Forms
41360,"is seen only on its idealistic side: in its way, it is realistic. There",Elementary Forms
41360,"is no physical or moral ugliness, there are no vices or evils which do",Elementary Forms
41360,"not have a special divinity. There are gods of theft and trickery, of",Elementary Forms
41360,"lust and war, of sickness and of death. Christianity itself, howsoever",Elementary Forms
41360,"high the idea which it has made of the divinity may be, has been obliged",Elementary Forms
41360,to give the spirit of evil a place in its mythology. Satan is an,Elementary Forms
41360,"essential piece of the Christian system; even if he is an impure being,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he is not a profane one. The anti-god, is a god, inferior and",Elementary Forms
41360,"subordinated, it is true, but nevertheless endowed with extended",Elementary Forms
41360,"powers; he is even the object of rites, at least of negative ones. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion, far from ignoring the real society and making abstraction of",Elementary Forms
41360,"it, is in its image; it reflects all its aspects, even the most vulgar",Elementary Forms
41360,"and the most repulsive. All is to be found there, and if in the majority",Elementary Forms
41360,"of cases we see the good victorious over evil, life over death, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"powers of light over the powers of darkness, it is because reality is",Elementary Forms
41360,not otherwise. If the relation between these two contrary forces were,Elementary Forms
41360,"reversed, life would be impossible; but, as a matter of fact, it",Elementary Forms
41360,maintains itself and even tends to develop.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if, in the midst of these mythologies and theologies we see reality",Elementary Forms
41360,"clearly appearing, it is none the less true that it is found there only",Elementary Forms
41360,"in an enlarged, transformed and idealized form. In this respect, the",Elementary Forms
41360,most primitive religions do not differ from the most recent and the most,Elementary Forms
41360,"refined. For example, we have seen how the Arunta place at the beginning",Elementary Forms
41360,of time a mythical society whose organization exactly reproduces that,Elementary Forms
41360,"which still exists to-day; it includes the same clans and phratries, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is under the same matrimonial rules and it practises the same rites. But,Elementary Forms
41360,"the personages who compose it are ideal beings, gifted with powers and",Elementary Forms
41360,virtues to which common mortals cannot pretend. Their nature is not only,Elementary Forms
41360,"higher, but it is different, since it is at once animal and human. The",Elementary Forms
41360,"evil powers there undergo a similar metamorphosis: evil itself is, as it",Elementary Forms
41360,"were, made sublime and idealized. The question now raises itself of",Elementary Forms
41360,whence this idealization comes.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Some reply that men have a natural faculty for idealizing, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, of substituting for the real world another different one, to which",Elementary Forms
41360,they transport themselves by thought. But that is merely changing the,Elementary Forms
41360,terms of the problem; it is not resolving it or even advancing it. This,Elementary Forms
41360,systematic idealization is an essential characteristic of religions.,Elementary Forms
41360,Explaining them by an innate power of idealization is simply replacing,Elementary Forms
41360,one word by another which is the equivalent of the first; it is as if,Elementary Forms
41360,they said that men have made religions because they have a religious,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature. Animals know only one world, the one which they perceive by",Elementary Forms
41360,"experience, internal as well as external. Men alone have the faculty of",Elementary Forms
41360,"conceiving the ideal, of adding something to the real. Now where does",Elementary Forms
41360,this singular privilege come from? Before making it an initial fact or a,Elementary Forms
41360,"mysterious virtue which escapes science, we must be sure that it does",Elementary Forms
41360,not depend upon empirically determinable conditions.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The explanation of religion which we have proposed has precisely this,Elementary Forms
41360,"advantage, that it gives an answer to this question. For our definition",Elementary Forms
41360,of the sacred is that it is something added to and above the real: now,Elementary Forms
41360,the ideal answers to this same definition; we cannot explain one without,Elementary Forms
41360,"explaining the other. In fact, we have seen that if collective life",Elementary Forms
41360,"awakens religious thought on reaching a certain degree of intensity, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is because it brings about a state of effervescence which changes the,Elementary Forms
41360,"conditions of psychic activity. Vital energies are over-excited,",Elementary Forms
41360,"passions more active, sensations stronger; there are even some which are",Elementary Forms
41360,produced only at this moment. A man does not recognize himself; he feels,Elementary Forms
41360,himself transformed and consequently he transforms the environment which,Elementary Forms
41360,surrounds him. In order to account for the very particular impressions,Elementary Forms
41360,"which he receives, he attributes to the things with which he is in most",Elementary Forms
41360,"direct contact properties which they have not, exceptional powers and",Elementary Forms
41360,virtues which the objects of every-day experience do not possess. In a,Elementary Forms
41360,"word, above the real world where his profane life passes he has placed",Elementary Forms
41360,"another which, in one sense, does not exist except in thought, but to",Elementary Forms
41360,"which he attributes a higher sort of dignity than to the first. Thus,",Elementary Forms
41360,from a double point of view it is an ideal world.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The formation of the ideal world is therefore not an irreducible fact,Elementary Forms
41360,which escapes science; it depends upon conditions which observation can,Elementary Forms
41360,touch; it is a natural product of social life. For a society to become,Elementary Forms
41360,conscious of itself and maintain at the necessary degree of intensity,Elementary Forms
41360,"the sentiments which it thus attains, it must assemble and concentrate",Elementary Forms
41360,itself. Now this concentration brings about an exaltation of the mental,Elementary Forms
41360,life which takes form in a group of ideal conceptions where is portrayed,Elementary Forms
41360,the new life thus awakened; they correspond to this new set of psychical,Elementary Forms
41360,forces which is added to those which we have at our disposition for the,Elementary Forms
41360,daily tasks of existence. A society can neither create itself nor,Elementary Forms
41360,recreate itself without at the same time creating an ideal. This,Elementary Forms
41360,"creation is not a sort of work of supererogation for it, by which it",Elementary Forms
41360,"would complete itself, being already formed; it is the act by which it",Elementary Forms
41360,is periodically made and remade. Therefore when some oppose the ideal,Elementary Forms
41360,"society to the real society, like two antagonists which would lead us in",Elementary Forms
41360,"opposite directions, they materialize and oppose abstractions. The ideal",Elementary Forms
41360,society is not outside of the real society; it is a part of it. Far from,Elementary Forms
41360,being divided between them as between two poles which mutually repel,Elementary Forms
41360,"each other, we cannot hold to one without holding to the other. For a",Elementary Forms
41360,"society is not made up merely of the mass of individuals who compose it,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the ground which they occupy, the things which they use and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"movements which they perform, but above all is the idea which it forms",Elementary Forms
41360,of itself. It is undoubtedly true that it hesitates over the manner in,Elementary Forms
41360,which it ought to conceive itself; it feels itself drawn in divergent,Elementary Forms
41360,directions. But these conflicts which break forth are not between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ideal and reality, but between two different ideals, that of yesterday",Elementary Forms
41360,"and that of to-day, that which has the authority of tradition and that",Elementary Forms
41360,which has the hope of the future. There is surely a place for,Elementary Forms
41360,investigating whence these ideals evolve; but whatever solution may be,Elementary Forms
41360,"given to this problem, it still remains that all passes in the world of",Elementary Forms
41360,the ideal.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the collective ideal which religion expresses is far from being due,Elementary Forms
41360,"to a vague innate power of the individual, but it is rather at the",Elementary Forms
41360,school of collective life that the individual has learned to idealize.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is in assimilating the ideals elaborated by society that he has,Elementary Forms
41360,"become capable of conceiving the ideal. It is society which, by leading",Elementary Forms
41360,"him within its sphere of action, has made him acquire the need of",Elementary Forms
41360,raising himself above the world of experience and has at the same time,Elementary Forms
41360,furnished him with the means of conceiving another. For society has,Elementary Forms
41360,"constructed this new world in constructing itself, since it is society",Elementary Forms
41360,"which this expresses. Thus both with the individual and in the group,",Elementary Forms
41360,the faculty of idealizing has nothing mysterious about it. It is not a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of luxury which a man could get along without, but a condition of",Elementary Forms
41360,"his very existence. He could not be a social being, that is to say, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"could not be a man, if he had not acquired it. It is true that in",Elementary Forms
41360,"incarnating themselves in individuals, collective ideals tend to",Elementary Forms
41360,individualize themselves. Each understands them after his own fashion,Elementary Forms
41360,and marks them with his own stamp; he suppresses certain elements and,Elementary Forms
41360,adds others. Thus the personal ideal disengages itself from the social,Elementary Forms
41360,ideal in proportion as the individual personality develops itself and,Elementary Forms
41360,becomes an autonomous source of action. But if we wish to understand,Elementary Forms
41360,"this aptitude, so singular in appearance, of living outside of reality,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is enough to connect it with the social conditions upon which it,Elementary Forms
41360,depends.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore it is necessary to avoid seeing in this theory of religion a,Elementary Forms
41360,simple restatement of historical materialism: that would be,Elementary Forms
41360,misunderstanding our thought to an extreme degree. In showing that,Elementary Forms
41360,"religion is something essentially social, we do not mean to say that it",Elementary Forms
41360,confines itself to translating into another language the material forms,Elementary Forms
41360,of society and its immediate vital necessities. It is true that we take,Elementary Forms
41360,it as evident that social life depends upon its material foundation and,Elementary Forms
41360,"bears its mark, just as the mental life of an individual depends upon",Elementary Forms
41360,his nervous system and in fact his whole organism. But collective,Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness is something more than a mere epiphenomenon of its,Elementary Forms
41360,"morphological basis, just as individual consciousness is something more",Elementary Forms
41360,than a simple efflorescence of the nervous system. In order that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"former may appear, a synthesis _sui generis_ of particular",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousnesses is required. Now this synthesis has the effect of,Elementary Forms
41360,"disengaging a whole world of sentiments, ideas and images which, once",Elementary Forms
41360,"born, obey laws all their own. They attract each other, repel each",Elementary Forms
41360,"other, unite, divide themselves, and multiply, though these combinations",Elementary Forms
41360,are not commanded and necessitated by the condition of the underlying,Elementary Forms
41360,reality. The life thus brought into being even enjoys so great an,Elementary Forms
41360,independence that it sometimes indulges in manifestations with no,Elementary Forms
41360,"purpose or utility of any sort, for the mere pleasure of affirming",Elementary Forms
41360,itself. We have shown that this is often precisely the case with ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,activity and mythological thought.[1307],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if religion is the product of social causes, how can we explain the",Elementary Forms
41360,individual cult and the universalistic character of certain religions?,Elementary Forms
41360,"If it is born _in foro externo_, how has it been able to pass into the",Elementary Forms
41360,inner conscience of the individual and penetrate there ever more and,Elementary Forms
41360,more profoundly? If it is the work of definite and individualized,Elementary Forms
41360,"societies, how has it been able to detach itself from them, even to the",Elementary Forms
41360,point of being conceived as something common to all humanity?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the course of our studies, we have met with the germs of individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"religion and of religious cosmopolitanism, and we have seen how they",Elementary Forms
41360,were formed; thus we possess the more general elements of the reply,Elementary Forms
41360,which is to be given to this double question.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have shown how the religious force which animates the clan,Elementary Forms
41360,"particularizes itself, by incarnating itself in particular",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousnesses. Thus secondary sacred beings are formed; each,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual has his own, made in his own image, associated to his own",Elementary Forms
41360,"intimate life, bound up with his own destiny; it is the soul, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individual totem, the protecting ancestor, etc. These beings are the",Elementary Forms
41360,"object of rites which the individual can celebrate by himself, outside",Elementary Forms
41360,"of any group; this is the first form of the individual cult. To be sure,",Elementary Forms
41360,it is only a very rudimentary cult; but since the personality of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual is still only slightly marked, and but little value is",Elementary Forms
41360,"attributed to it, the cult which expresses it could hardly be expected",Elementary Forms
41360,to be very highly developed as yet. But as individuals have,Elementary Forms
41360,differentiated themselves more and more and the value of an individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"has increased, the corresponding cult has taken a relatively greater",Elementary Forms
41360,place in the totality of the religious life and at the same time it is,Elementary Forms
41360,more fully closed to outside influences.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus the existence of individual cults implies nothing which contradicts,Elementary Forms
41360,or embarrasses the sociological interpretation of religion; for the,Elementary Forms
41360,religious forces to which it addresses itself are only the,Elementary Forms
41360,"individualized forms of collective forces. Therefore, even when religion",Elementary Forms
41360,"seems to be entirely within the individual conscience, it is still in",Elementary Forms
41360,society that it finds the living source from which it is nourished. We,Elementary Forms
41360,are now able to appreciate the value of the radical individualism which,Elementary Forms
41360,would make religion something purely individual: it misunderstands the,Elementary Forms
41360,fundamental conditions of the religious life. If up to the present it,Elementary Forms
41360,has remained in the stage of theoretical aspirations which have never,Elementary Forms
41360,"been realized, it is because it is unrealizable. A philosophy may well",Elementary Forms
41360,"be elaborated in the silence of the interior imagination, but not so a",Elementary Forms
41360,"faith. For before all else, a faith is warmth, life, enthusiasm, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"exaltation of the whole mental life, the raising of the individual above",Elementary Forms
41360,himself. Now how could he add to the energies which he possesses without,Elementary Forms
41360,going outside himself? How could he surpass himself merely by his own,Elementary Forms
41360,forces? The only source of life at which we can morally reanimate,Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves is that formed by the society of our fellow beings; the only,Elementary Forms
41360,moral forces with which we can sustain and increase our own are those,Elementary Forms
41360,which we get from others. Let us even admit that there really are beings,Elementary Forms
41360,more or less analogous to those which the mythologies represent. In,Elementary Forms
41360,order that they may exercise over souls the useful direction which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"their reason for existence, it is necessary that men believe in them.",Elementary Forms
41360,Now these beliefs are active only when they are partaken by many. A man,Elementary Forms
41360,cannot retain them any length of time by a purely personal effort; it is,Elementary Forms
41360,not thus that they are born or that they are acquired; it is even,Elementary Forms
41360,"doubtful if they can be kept under these conditions. In fact, a man who",Elementary Forms
41360,has a veritable faith feels an invincible need of spreading it:,Elementary Forms
41360,"therefore he leaves his isolation, approaches others and seeks to",Elementary Forms
41360,"convince them, and it is the ardour of the convictions which he arouses",Elementary Forms
41360,that strengthens his own. It would quickly weaken if it remained alone.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is the same with religious universalism as with this individualism.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Far from being an exclusive attribute of certain very great religions,",Elementary Forms
41360,"we have found it, not at the base, it is true, but at the summit of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Australian system. Bunjil, Daramulun or Baiame are not simple tribal",Elementary Forms
41360,gods; each of them is recognized by a number of different tribes. In a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sense, their cult is international. This conception is therefore very",Elementary Forms
41360,near to that found in the most recent theologies. So certain writers,Elementary Forms
41360,"have felt it their duty to deny its authenticity, howsoever",Elementary Forms
41360,incontestable this may be.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,And we have been able to show how this has been formed.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Neighbouring tribes of a similar civilization cannot fail to be in,Elementary Forms
41360,constant relations with each other. All sorts of circumstances give an,Elementary Forms
41360,"occasion for it: besides commerce, which is still rudimentary, there are",Elementary Forms
41360,marriages; these international marriages are very common in Australia.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In the course of these meetings, men naturally become conscious of the",Elementary Forms
41360,moral relationship which united them. They have the same social,Elementary Forms
41360,"organization, the same division into phratries, clans and matrimonial",Elementary Forms
41360,"classes; they practise the same rites of initiation, or wholly similar",Elementary Forms
41360,ones. Mutual loans and treaties result in reinforcing these spontaneous,Elementary Forms
41360,resemblances. The gods to which these manifestly identical institutions,Elementary Forms
41360,were attached could hardly have remained distinct in their minds.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Everything tended to bring them together and consequently, even",Elementary Forms
41360,"supposing that each tribe elaborated the notion independently, they must",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessarily have tended to confound themselves with each other. Also, it",Elementary Forms
41360,is probable that it was in inter-tribal assemblies that they were first,Elementary Forms
41360,"conceived. For they are chiefly the gods of initiation, and in the",Elementary Forms
41360,"initiation ceremonies, the different tribes are usually represented. So",Elementary Forms
41360,if sacred beings are formed which are connected with no geographically,Elementary Forms
41360,"determined society, that is not because they have an extra-social",Elementary Forms
41360,origin. It is because there are other groups above these geographically,Elementary Forms
41360,"determined ones, whose contours are less clearly marked: they have no",Elementary Forms
41360,"fixed frontiers, but include all sorts of more or less neighbouring and",Elementary Forms
41360,related tribes. The particular social life thus created tends to spread,Elementary Forms
41360,itself over an area with no definite limits. Naturally the mythological,Elementary Forms
41360,personages who correspond to it have the same character; their sphere of,Elementary Forms
41360,influence is not limited; they go beyond the particular tribes and their,Elementary Forms
41360,territory. They are the great international gods.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Now there is nothing in this situation which is peculiar to Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,societies. There is no people and no state which is not a part of,Elementary Forms
41360,"another society, more or less unlimited, which embraces all the peoples",Elementary Forms
41360,"and all the States with which the first comes in contact, either",Elementary Forms
41360,directly or indirectly; there is no national life which is not dominated,Elementary Forms
41360,by a collective life of an international nature. In proportion as we,Elementary Forms
41360,"advance in history, these international groups acquire a greater",Elementary Forms
41360,"importance and extent. Thus we see how, in certain cases, this",Elementary Forms
41360,universalistic tendency has been able to develop itself to the point of,Elementary Forms
41360,"affecting not only the higher ideas of the religious system, but even",Elementary Forms
41360,the principles upon which it rests.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,II,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive,Elementary Forms
41360,all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively,Elementary Forms
41360,enveloped itself. There can be no society which does not feel the need,Elementary Forms
41360,of upholding and reaffirming at regular intervals the collective,Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments and the collective ideas which make its unity and its,Elementary Forms
41360,personality. Now this moral remaking cannot be achieved except by the,Elementary Forms
41360,"means of reunions, assemblies and meetings where the individuals, being",Elementary Forms
41360,"closely united to one another, reaffirm in common their common",Elementary Forms
41360,sentiments; hence come ceremonies which do not differ from regular,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious ceremonies, either in their object, the results which they",Elementary Forms
41360,"produce, or the processes employed to attain these results. What",Elementary Forms
41360,essential difference is there between an assembly of Christians,Elementary Forms
41360,"celebrating the principal dates of the life of Christ, or of Jews",Elementary Forms
41360,"remembering the exodus from Egypt or the promulgation of the decalogue,",Elementary Forms
41360,and a reunion of citizens commemorating the promulgation of a new moral,Elementary Forms
41360,or legal system or some great event in the national life?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If we find a little difficulty to-day in imagining what these feasts and,Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremonies of the future could consist in, it is because we are going",Elementary Forms
41360,through a stage of transition and moral mediocrity. The great things of,Elementary Forms
41360,the past which filled our fathers with enthusiasm do not excite the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"ardour in us, either because they have come into common usage to such an",Elementary Forms
41360,"extent that we are unconscious of them, or else because they no longer",Elementary Forms
41360,answer to our actual aspirations; but as yet there is nothing to replace,Elementary Forms
41360,them. We can no longer impassionate ourselves for the principles in the,Elementary Forms
41360,name of which Christianity recommended to masters that they treat their,Elementary Forms
41360,"slaves humanely, and, on the other hand, the idea which it has formed of",Elementary Forms
41360,human equality and fraternity seems to us to-day to leave too large a,Elementary Forms
41360,place for unjust inequalities. Its pity for the outcast seems to us too,Elementary Forms
41360,Platonic; we desire another which would be more practicable; but as yet,Elementary Forms
41360,we cannot clearly see what it should be nor how it could be realized in,Elementary Forms
41360,"facts. In a word, the old gods are growing old or already dead, and",Elementary Forms
41360,others are not yet born. This is what rendered vain the attempt of Comte,Elementary Forms
41360,"with the old historic souvenirs artificially revived; it is life itself,",Elementary Forms
41360,and not a dead past which can produce a living cult. But this state of,Elementary Forms
41360,incertitude and confused agitation cannot last for ever. A day will come,Elementary Forms
41360,when our societies will know again those hours of creative,Elementary Forms
41360,"effervescence, in the course of which new ideas arise and new formulae",Elementary Forms
41360,are found which serve for a while as a guide to humanity; and when these,Elementary Forms
41360,"hours shall have been passed through once, men will spontaneously feel",Elementary Forms
41360,"the need of reliving them from time to time in thought, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,of keeping alive their memory by means of celebrations which regularly,Elementary Forms
41360,reproduce their fruits. We have already seen how the French Revolution,Elementary Forms
41360,established a whole cycle of holidays to keep the principles with which,Elementary Forms
41360,it was inspired in a state of perpetual youth. If this institution,Elementary Forms
41360,"quickly fell away, it was because the revolutionary faith lasted but a",Elementary Forms
41360,"moment, and deceptions and discouragements rapidly succeeded the first",Elementary Forms
41360,"moments of enthusiasm. But though the work may have miscarried, it",Elementary Forms
41360,enables us to imagine what might have happened in other conditions; and,Elementary Forms
41360,everything leads us to believe that it will be taken up again sooner or,Elementary Forms
41360,"later. There are no gospels which are immortal, but neither is there any",Elementary Forms
41360,reason for believing that humanity is incapable of inventing new ones.,Elementary Forms
41360,As to the question of what symbols this new faith will express itself,Elementary Forms
41360,"with, whether they will resemble those of the past or not, and whether",Elementary Forms
41360,or not they will be more adequate for the reality which they seek to,Elementary Forms
41360,"translate, that is something which surpasses the human faculty of",Elementary Forms
41360,foresight and which does not appertain to the principal question.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But feasts and rites, in a word, the cult, are not the whole religion.",Elementary Forms
41360,"This is not merely a system of practices, but also a system of ideas",Elementary Forms
41360,whose object is to explain the world; we have seen that even the,Elementary Forms
41360,humblest have their cosmology. Whatever connection there may be between,Elementary Forms
41360,"these two elements of the religious life, they are still quite",Elementary Forms
41360,"different. The one is turned towards action, which it demands and",Elementary Forms
41360,"regulates; the other is turned towards thought, which it enriches and",Elementary Forms
41360,"organizes. Then they do not depend upon the same conditions, and",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently it may be asked if the second answers to necessities as,Elementary Forms
41360,universal and as permanent as the first.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"When specific characteristics are attributed to religious thought, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"when it is believed that its function is to express, by means peculiar",Elementary Forms
41360,"to itself, an aspect of reality which evades ordinary knowledge as well",Elementary Forms
41360,"as science, one naturally refuses to admit that religion can ever",Elementary Forms
41360,abandon its speculative role. But our analysis of the facts does not,Elementary Forms
41360,seem to have shown this specific quality of religion. The religion which,Elementary Forms
41360,we have just studied is one of those whose symbols are the most,Elementary Forms
41360,disconcerting for the reason. There all appears mysterious. These beings,Elementary Forms
41360,"which belong to the most heterogeneous groups at the same time, who",Elementary Forms
41360,"multiply without ceasing to be one, who divide without diminishing, all",Elementary Forms
41360,"seem, at first view, to belong to an entirely different world from the",Elementary Forms
41360,one where we live; some have even gone so far as to say that the mind,Elementary Forms
41360,which constructed them ignored the laws of logic completely. Perhaps the,Elementary Forms
41360,contrast between reason and faith has never been more thorough. Then if,Elementary Forms
41360,there has ever been a moment in history when their heterogeneousness,Elementary Forms
41360,"should have stood out clearly, it is here. But contrary to all",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearances, as we have pointed out, the realities to which religious",Elementary Forms
41360,speculation is then applied are the same as those which later serve as,Elementary Forms
41360,"the subject of reflection for philosophers: they are nature, man,",Elementary Forms
41360,society. The mystery which appears to surround them is wholly,Elementary Forms
41360,superficial and disappears before a more painstaking observation: it is,Elementary Forms
41360,enough merely to set aside the veil with which mythological imagination,Elementary Forms
41360,has covered them for them to appear such as they really are. Religion,Elementary Forms
41360,sets itself to translate these realities into an intelligible language,Elementary Forms
41360,which does not differ in nature from that employed by science; the,Elementary Forms
41360,"attempt is made by both to connect things with each other, to establish",Elementary Forms
41360,"internal relations between them, to classify them and to systematize",Elementary Forms
41360,them. We have even seen that the essential ideas of scientific logic are,Elementary Forms
41360,"of religious origin. It is true that in order to utilize them, science",Elementary Forms
41360,gives them a new elaboration; it purges them of all accidental elements;,Elementary Forms
41360,"in a general way, it brings a spirit of criticism into all its doings,",Elementary Forms
41360,"which religion ignores; it surrounds itself with precautions to ""escape",Elementary Forms
41360,"precipitation and bias,"" and to hold aside the passions, prejudices and",Elementary Forms
41360,all subjective influences. But these perfectionings of method are not,Elementary Forms
41360,"enough to differentiate it from religion. In this regard, both pursue",Elementary Forms
41360,the same end; scientific thought is only a more perfect form of,Elementary Forms
41360,religious thought. Thus it seems natural that the second should,Elementary Forms
41360,"progressively retire before the first, as this becomes better fitted to",Elementary Forms
41360,perform the task.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,And there is no doubt that this regression has taken place in the course,Elementary Forms
41360,"of history. Having left religion, science tends to substitute itself for",Elementary Forms
41360,this latter in all that which concerns the cognitive and intellectual,Elementary Forms
41360,functions. Christianity has already definitely consecrated this,Elementary Forms
41360,substitution in the order of material things. Seeing in matter that,Elementary Forms
41360,"which is profane before all else, it readily left the knowledge of this",Elementary Forms
41360,"to another discipline, _tradidit mundum hominum disputationi_, ""He gave",Elementary Forms
41360,"the world over to the disputes of men""; it is thus that the natural",Elementary Forms
41360,sciences have been able to establish themselves and make their authority,Elementary Forms
41360,recognized without very great difficulty. But it could not give up the,Elementary Forms
41360,world of souls so easily; for it is before all over souls that the god,Elementary Forms
41360,of the Christians aspires to reign. That is why the idea of submitting,Elementary Forms
41360,the psychic life to science produced the effect of a sort of profanation,Elementary Forms
41360,"for a long time; even to-day it is repugnant to many minds. However,",Elementary Forms
41360,experimental and comparative psychology is founded and to-day we must,Elementary Forms
41360,reckon with it. But the world of the religious and moral life is still,Elementary Forms
41360,forbidden. The great majority of men continue to believe that here there,Elementary Forms
41360,is an order of things which the mind cannot penetrate except by very,Elementary Forms
41360,special ways. Hence comes the active resistance which is met with every,Elementary Forms
41360,time that someone tries to treat religious and moral phenomena,Elementary Forms
41360,"scientifically. But in spite of these oppositions, these attempts are",Elementary Forms
41360,constantly repeated and this persistence even allows us to foresee that,Elementary Forms
41360,this final barrier will finally give way and that science will establish,Elementary Forms
41360,herself as mistress even in this reserved region.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,That is what the conflict between science and religion really amounts,Elementary Forms
41360,to. It is said that science denies religion in principle. But religion,Elementary Forms
41360,"exists; it is a system of given facts; in a word, it is a reality. How",Elementary Forms
41360,"could science deny this reality? Also, in so far as religion is action,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and in so far as it is a means of making men live, science could not",Elementary Forms
41360,"take its place, for even if this expresses life, it does not create it;",Elementary Forms
41360,"it may well seek to explain the faith, but by that very act it",Elementary Forms
41360,presupposes it. Thus there is no conflict except upon one limited point.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Of the two functions which religion originally fulfilled, there is one,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and only one, which tends to escape it more and more: that is its",Elementary Forms
41360,speculative function. That which science refuses to grant to religion is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not its right to exist, but its right to dogmatize upon the nature of",Elementary Forms
41360,things and the special competence which it claims for itself for knowing,Elementary Forms
41360,"man and the world. As a matter of fact, it does not know itself. It does",Elementary Forms
41360,"not even know what it is made of, nor to what need it answers. It is",Elementary Forms
41360,"itself a subject for science, so far is it from being able to make the",Elementary Forms
41360,"law for science! And from another point of view, since there is no",Elementary Forms
41360,proper subject for religious speculation outside that reality to which,Elementary Forms
41360,"scientific reflection is applied, it is evident that this former cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,play the same role in the future that it has played in the past.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, it seems destined to transform itself rather than to disappear.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We have said that there is something eternal in religion: it is the cult,Elementary Forms
41360,and the faith. Men cannot celebrate ceremonies for which they see no,Elementary Forms
41360,"reason, nor can they accept a faith which they in no way understand. To",Elementary Forms
41360,"spread itself or merely to maintain itself, it must be justified, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, a theory must be made of it. A theory of this sort must",Elementary Forms
41360,"undoubtedly be founded upon the different sciences, from the moment",Elementary Forms
41360,"when these exist; first of all, upon the social sciences, for religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"faith has its origin in society; then upon psychology, for society is a",Elementary Forms
41360,synthesis of human consciousnesses; and finally upon the sciences of,Elementary Forms
41360,"nature, for man and society are a part of the universe and can be",Elementary Forms
41360,abstracted from it only artificially. But howsoever important these,Elementary Forms
41360,"facts taken from the constituted sciences may be, they are not enough;",Elementary Forms
41360,"for faith is before all else an impetus to action, while science, no",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter how far it may be pushed, always remains at a distance from this.",Elementary Forms
41360,Science is fragmentary and incomplete; it advances but slowly and is,Elementary Forms
41360,never finished; but life cannot wait. The theories which are destined to,Elementary Forms
41360,make men live and act are therefore obliged to pass science and complete,Elementary Forms
41360,it prematurely. They are possible only when the practical exigencies and,Elementary Forms
41360,the vital necessities which we feel without distinctly conceiving them,Elementary Forms
41360,"push thought in advance, beyond that which science permits us to affirm.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus religions, even the most rational and laicized, cannot and never",Elementary Forms
41360,"will be able to dispense with a particular form of speculation which,",Elementary Forms
41360,"though having the same subjects as science itself, cannot be really",Elementary Forms
41360,scientific: the obscure intuitions of sensation and sentiment too often,Elementary Forms
41360,"take the place of logical reasons. On one side, this speculation",Elementary Forms
41360,resembles that which we meet with in the religions of the past; but on,Elementary Forms
41360,"another, it is different. While claiming and exercising the right of",Elementary Forms
41360,"going beyond science, it must commence by knowing this and by inspiring",Elementary Forms
41360,"itself with it. Ever since the authority of science was established, it",Elementary Forms
41360,must be reckoned with; one can go farther than it under the pressure of,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity, but he must take his direction from it. He can affirm nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,"that it denies, deny nothing that it affirms, and establish nothing that",Elementary Forms
41360,is not directly or indirectly founded upon principles taken from it.,Elementary Forms
41360,"From now on, the faith no longer exercises the same hegemony as formerly",Elementary Forms
41360,over the system of ideas that we may continue to call religion. A rival,Elementary Forms
41360,"power rises up before it which, being born of it, ever after submits it",Elementary Forms
41360,to its criticism and control. And everything makes us foresee that this,Elementary Forms
41360,"control will constantly become more extended and efficient, while no",Elementary Forms
41360,limit can be assigned to its future influence.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,III,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But if the fundamental notions of science are of a religious origin, how",Elementary Forms
41360,"has religion been able to bring them forth? At first sight, one does not",Elementary Forms
41360,"see what relations there can be between religion and logic. Or, since",Elementary Forms
41360,"the reality which religious thought expresses is society, the question",Elementary Forms
41360,"can be stated in the following terms, which make the entire difficulty",Elementary Forms
41360,appear even better: what has been able to make social life so important,Elementary Forms
41360,a source for the logical life? It seems as though nothing could have,Elementary Forms
41360,"predestined it to this role, for it certainly was not to satisfy their",Elementary Forms
41360,speculative needs that men associated themselves together.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Perhaps we shall be found over bold in attempting so complex a question,Elementary Forms
41360,"here. To treat it as it should be treated, the sociological conditions",Elementary Forms
41360,of knowledge should be known much better than they actually are; we are,Elementary Forms
41360,"only beginning to catch glimpses of some of them. However, the question",Elementary Forms
41360,"is so grave, and so directly implied in all that has preceded, that we",Elementary Forms
41360,must make an effort not to leave it without an answer. Perhaps it is not,Elementary Forms
41360,"impossible, even at present, to state some general principles which may",Elementary Forms
41360,at least aid in the solution.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Logical thought is made up of concepts. Seeking how society can have,Elementary Forms
41360,played a role in the genesis of logical thought thus reduces itself to,Elementary Forms
41360,seeking how it can have taken a part in the formation of concepts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"If, as is ordinarily the case, we see in the concept only a general",Elementary Forms
41360,"idea, the problem appears insoluble. By his own power, the individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"can compare his conceptions and images, disengage that which they have",Elementary Forms
41360,"in common, and thus, in a word, generalize. Then it is hard to see why",Elementary Forms
41360,"this generalization should be possible only in and through society. But,",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the first place, it is inadmissible that logical thought is",Elementary Forms
41360,characterized only by the greater extension of the conceptions of which,Elementary Forms
41360,"it is made up. If particular ideas have nothing logical about them, why",Elementary Forms
41360,should it be different with general ones? The general exists only in the,Elementary Forms
41360,particular; it is the particular simplified and impoverished. Then the,Elementary Forms
41360,first could have no virtues or privileges which the second has not.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Inversely, if conceptual thought can be applied to the class, species or",Elementary Forms
41360,"variety, howsoever restricted these may be, why can it not be extended",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the individual, that is to say, to the limit towards which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"conception tends, proportionately as its extension diminishes? As a",Elementary Forms
41360,"matter of fact, there are many concepts which have only individuals as",Elementary Forms
41360,"their object. In every sort of religion, gods are individualities",Elementary Forms
41360,"distinct from each other; however, they are conceived, not perceived.",Elementary Forms
41360,Each people represents its historic or legendary heroes in fashions,Elementary Forms
41360,"which vary with the time. Finally, every one of us forms an idea of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"individuals with whom he comes in contact, of their character, of their",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearance, their distinctive traits and their moral and physical",Elementary Forms
41360,"temperaments: these notions, too, are real concepts. It is true that in",Elementary Forms
41360,general they are formed crudely enough; but even among scientific,Elementary Forms
41360,"concepts, are there a great many that are perfectly adequate for their",Elementary Forms
41360,"object? In this direction, there are only differences of degree between",Elementary Forms
41360,them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Therefore the concept must be defined by other characteristics. It is,Elementary Forms
41360,"opposed to sensual representations of every order--sensations,",Elementary Forms
41360,perceptions or images--by the following properties.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Sensual representations are in a perpetual flux; they come after each,Elementary Forms
41360,"other like the waves of a river, and even during the time that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"last, they do not remain the same thing. Each of them is an integral",Elementary Forms
41360,part of the precise instant when it takes place. We are never sure of,Elementary Forms
41360,again finding a perception such as we experienced it the first time; for,Elementary Forms
41360,"if the thing perceived has not changed, it is we who are no longer the",Elementary Forms
41360,"same. On the contrary, the concept is, as it were, outside of time and",Elementary Forms
41360,change; it is in the depths below all this agitation; it might be said,Elementary Forms
41360,"that it is in a different portion of the mind, which is serener and",Elementary Forms
41360,"calmer. It does not move of itself, by an internal and spontaneous",Elementary Forms
41360,"evolution, but, on the contrary, it resists change. It is a manner of",Elementary Forms
41360,"thinking that, at every moment of time, is fixed and crystallized.[1308]",Elementary Forms
41360,"In so far as it is what it ought to be, it is immutable. If it changes,",Elementary Forms
41360,"it is not because it is its nature to do so, but because we have",Elementary Forms
41360,discovered some imperfection in it; it is because it had to be,Elementary Forms
41360,rectified. The system of concepts with which we think in everyday life,Elementary Forms
41360,is that expressed by the vocabulary of our mother tongue; for every word,Elementary Forms
41360,translates a concept. Now language is something fixed; it changes but,Elementary Forms
41360,"very slowly, and consequently it is the same with the conceptual system",Elementary Forms
41360,which it expresses. The scholar finds himself in the same situation in,Elementary Forms
41360,regard to the special terminology employed by the science to which he,Elementary Forms
41360,"has consecrated himself, and hence in regard to the special scheme of",Elementary Forms
41360,concepts to which this terminology corresponds. It is true that he can,Elementary Forms
41360,"make innovations, but these are always a sort of violence done to the",Elementary Forms
41360,established ways of thinking.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"And at the same time that it is relatively immutable, the concept is",Elementary Forms
41360,"universal, or at least capable of becoming so. A concept is not my",Elementary Forms
41360,"concept; I hold it in common with other men, or, in any case, can",Elementary Forms
41360,communicate it to them. It is impossible for me to make a sensation pass,Elementary Forms
41360,from my consciousness into that of another; it holds closely to my,Elementary Forms
41360,organism and personality and cannot be detached from them. All that I,Elementary Forms
41360,can do is to invite others to place themselves before the same object as,Elementary Forms
41360,"myself and to leave themselves to its action. On the other hand,",Elementary Forms
41360,conversation and all intellectual communication between men is an,Elementary Forms
41360,exchange of concepts. The concept is an essentially impersonal,Elementary Forms
41360,representation; it is through it that human intelligences,Elementary Forms
41360,communicate.[1309],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The nature of the concept, thus defined, bespeaks its origin. If it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"common to all, it is the work of the community. Since it bears the mark",Elementary Forms
41360,"of no particular mind, it is clear that it was elaborated by a unique",Elementary Forms
41360,"intelligence, where all others meet each other, and after a fashion,",Elementary Forms
41360,come to nourish themselves. If it has more stability than sensations or,Elementary Forms
41360,"images, it is because the collective representations are more stable",Elementary Forms
41360,than the individual ones; for while an individual is conscious even of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the slight changes which take place in his environment, only events of a",Elementary Forms
41360,greater gravity can succeed in affecting the mental status of a society.,Elementary Forms
41360,Every time that we are in the presence of a _type_[1310] of thought or,Elementary Forms
41360,action which is imposed uniformly upon particular wills or,Elementary Forms
41360,"intelligences, this pressure exercised over the individual betrays the",Elementary Forms
41360,"intervention of the group. Also, as we have already said, the concepts",Elementary Forms
41360,with which we ordinarily think are those of our vocabulary. Now it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"unquestionable that language, and consequently the system of concepts",Elementary Forms
41360,"which it translates, is the product of a collective elaboration. What it",Elementary Forms
41360,expresses is the manner in which society as a whole represents the facts,Elementary Forms
41360,of experience. The ideas which correspond to the diverse elements of,Elementary Forms
41360,language are thus collective representations.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Even their contents bear witness to the same fact. In fact, there are",Elementary Forms
41360,scarcely any words among those which we usually employ whose meaning,Elementary Forms
41360,"does not pass, to a greater or less extent, the limits of our personal",Elementary Forms
41360,experience. Very frequently a term expresses things which we have never,Elementary Forms
41360,perceived or experiences which we have never had or of which we have,Elementary Forms
41360,never been the witnesses. Even when we know some of the objects which it,Elementary Forms
41360,"concerns, it is only as particular examples that they serve to",Elementary Forms
41360,illustrate the idea which they would never have been able to form by,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves. Thus there is a great deal of knowledge condensed in the,Elementary Forms
41360,"word which I never collected, and which is not individual; it even",Elementary Forms
41360,surpasses me to such an extent that I cannot even completely appropriate,Elementary Forms
41360,all its results. Which of us knows all the words of the language he,Elementary Forms
41360,speaks and the entire signification of each?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,This remark enables us to determine the sense in which we mean to say,Elementary Forms
41360,that concepts are collective representations. If they belong to a whole,Elementary Forms
41360,"social group, it is not because they represent the average of the",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding individual representations; for in that case they would be,Elementary Forms
41360,"poorer than the latter in intellectual content, while, as a matter of",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, they contain much that surpasses the knowledge of the average",Elementary Forms
41360,individual. They are not abstractions which have a reality only in,Elementary Forms
41360,"particular consciousnesses, but they are as concrete representations as",Elementary Forms
41360,an individual could form of his own personal environment: they,Elementary Forms
41360,"correspond to the way in which this very special being, society,",Elementary Forms
41360,"considers the things of its own proper experience. If, as a matter of",Elementary Forms
41360,"fact, the concepts are nearly always general ideas, and if they express",Elementary Forms
41360,"categories and classes rather than particular objects, it is because the",Elementary Forms
41360,unique and variable characteristics of things interest society but,Elementary Forms
41360,"rarely; because of its very extent, it can scarcely be affected by more",Elementary Forms
41360,than their general and permanent qualities. Therefore it is to this,Elementary Forms
41360,aspect of affairs that it gives its attention: it is a part of its,Elementary Forms
41360,nature to see things in large and under the aspect which they ordinarily,Elementary Forms
41360,"have. But this generality is not necessary for them, and, in any case,",Elementary Forms
41360,even when these representations have the generic character which they,Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinarily have, they are the work of society and are enriched by its",Elementary Forms
41360,experience.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,That is what makes conceptual thought so valuable for us. If concepts,Elementary Forms
41360,"were only general ideas, they would not enrich knowledge a great deal,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for, as we have already pointed out, the general contains nothing more",Elementary Forms
41360,than the particular. But if before all else they are collective,Elementary Forms
41360,"representations, they add to that which we can learn by our own personal",Elementary Forms
41360,experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing",Elementary Forms
41360,"reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the",Elementary Forms
41360,"sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.",Elementary Forms
41360,Conceiving something is both learning its essential elements better and,Elementary Forms
41360,also locating it in its place; for each civilization has its organized,Elementary Forms
41360,"system of concepts which characterizes it. Before this scheme of ideas,",Elementary Forms
41360,the individual is in the same situation as the [Greek: nous] of Plato,Elementary Forms
41360,"before the world of Ideas. He must assimilate them to himself, for he",Elementary Forms
41360,must have them to hold intercourse with others; but the assimilation is,Elementary Forms
41360,always imperfect. Each of us sees them after his own fashion. There are,Elementary Forms
41360,some which escape us completely and remain outside of our circle of,Elementary Forms
41360,vision; there are others of which we perceive certain aspects only.,Elementary Forms
41360,"There are even a great many which we pervert in holding, for as they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"collective by nature, they cannot become individualized without being",Elementary Forms
41360,"retouched, modified, and consequently falsified. Hence comes the great",Elementary Forms
41360,"trouble we have in understanding each other, and the fact that we even",Elementary Forms
41360,lie to each other without wishing to: it is because we all use the same,Elementary Forms
41360,words without giving them the same meaning.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are now able to see what the part of society in the genesis of,Elementary Forms
41360,"logical thought is. This is possible only from the moment when, above",Elementary Forms
41360,"the fugitive conceptions which they owe to sensuous experience, men have",Elementary Forms
41360,"succeeded in conceiving a whole world of stable ideas, the common ground",Elementary Forms
41360,"of all intelligences. In fact, logical thinking is always impersonal",Elementary Forms
41360,"thinking, and is also thought _sub species aetrnitatis_--as though for",Elementary Forms
41360,all time. Impersonality and stability are the two characteristics of,Elementary Forms
41360,"truth. Now logical life evidently presupposes that men know, at least",Elementary Forms
41360,"confusedly, that there is such a thing as truth, distinct from sensuous",Elementary Forms
41360,appearances. But how have they been able to arrive at this conception?,Elementary Forms
41360,We generally talk as though it should have spontaneously presented,Elementary Forms
41360,itself to them from the moment they opened their eyes upon the world.,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, there is nothing in immediate experience which could suggest",Elementary Forms
41360,it; everything even contradicts it. Thus the child and the animal have,Elementary Forms
41360,no suspicion of it. History shows that it has taken centuries for it to,Elementary Forms
41360,"disengage and establish itself. In our Western world, it was with the",Elementary Forms
41360,great thinkers of Greece that it first became clearly conscious of,Elementary Forms
41360,itself and of the consequences which it implies; when the discovery was,Elementary Forms
41360,"made, it caused an amazement which Plato has translated into magnificent",Elementary Forms
41360,language. But if it is only at this epoch that the idea is expressed in,Elementary Forms
41360,"philosophic formulae, it was necessarily pre-existent in the stage of an",Elementary Forms
41360,"obscure sentiment. Philosophers have sought to elucidate this sentiment,",Elementary Forms
41360,but they have not succeeded. In order that they might reflect upon it,Elementary Forms
41360,"and analyse it, it was necessary that it be given them, and that they",Elementary Forms
41360,"seek to know whence it came, that is to say, in what experience it was",Elementary Forms
41360,founded. This is in collective experience. It is under the form of,Elementary Forms
41360,collective thought that impersonal thought is for the first time,Elementary Forms
41360,revealed to humanity; we cannot see by what other way this revelation,Elementary Forms
41360,"could have been made. From the mere fact that society exists, there is",Elementary Forms
41360,"also, outside of the individual sensations and images, a whole system of",Elementary Forms
41360,"representations which enjoy marvellous properties. By means of them, men",Elementary Forms
41360,understand each other and intelligences grasp each other. They have,Elementary Forms
41360,"within them a sort of force or moral ascendancy, in virtue of which they",Elementary Forms
41360,impose themselves upon individual minds. Hence the individual at least,Elementary Forms
41360,"obscurely takes account of the fact that above his private ideas, there",Elementary Forms
41360,is a world of absolute ideas according to which he must shape his own;,Elementary Forms
41360,he catches a glimpse of a whole intellectual kingdom in which he,Elementary Forms
41360,"participates, but which is greater than he. This is the first intuition",Elementary Forms
41360,of the realm of truth. From the moment when he first becomes conscious,Elementary Forms
41360,"of these higher ideas, he sets himself to scrutinizing their nature; he",Elementary Forms
41360,asks whence these pre-eminent representations hold their prerogatives,Elementary Forms
41360,"and, in so far as he believes that he has discovered their causes, he",Elementary Forms
41360,"undertakes to put these causes into action for himself, in order that he",Elementary Forms
41360,may draw from them by his own force the effects which they produce; that,Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, he attributes to himself the right of making concepts. Thus",Elementary Forms
41360,the faculty of conception has individualized itself. But to understand,Elementary Forms
41360,"its origins and function, it must be attached to the social conditions",Elementary Forms
41360,upon which it depends.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It may be objected that we show the concept in one of its aspects only,",Elementary Forms
41360,"and that its unique role is not the assuring of a harmony among minds,",Elementary Forms
41360,"but also, and to a greater extent, their harmony with the nature of",Elementary Forms
41360,things. It seems as though it had a reason for existence only on,Elementary Forms
41360,"condition of being true, that is to say, objective, and as though its",Elementary Forms
41360,impersonality were only a consequence of its objectivity. It is in,Elementary Forms
41360,"regard to things, thought of as adequately as possible, that minds ought",Elementary Forms
41360,to communicate. Nor do we deny that the evolution of concepts has been,Elementary Forms
41360,partially in this direction. The concept which was first held as true,Elementary Forms
41360,because it was collective tends to be no longer collective except on,Elementary Forms
41360,condition of being held as true: we demand its credentials of it before,Elementary Forms
41360,according it our confidence. But we must not lose sight of the fact that,Elementary Forms
41360,even to-day the great majority of the concepts which we use are not,Elementary Forms
41360,"methodically constituted; we get them from language, that is to say,",Elementary Forms
41360,"from common experience, without submitting them to any criticism. The",Elementary Forms
41360,scientifically elaborated and criticized concepts are always in the very,Elementary Forms
41360,"slight minority. Also, between them and those which draw all their",Elementary Forms
41360,"authority from the fact that they are collective, there are only",Elementary Forms
41360,differences of degree. A collective representation presents guarantees,Elementary Forms
41360,of objectivity by the fact that it is collective: for it is not without,Elementary Forms
41360,sufficient reason that it has been able to generalize and maintain,Elementary Forms
41360,itself with persistence. If it were out of accord with the nature of,Elementary Forms
41360,"things, it would never have been able to acquire an extended and",Elementary Forms
41360,"prolonged empire over intellects. At bottom, the confidence inspired by",Elementary Forms
41360,scientific concepts is due to the fact that they can be methodically,Elementary Forms
41360,controlled. But a collective representation is necessarily submitted to,Elementary Forms
41360,a control that is repeated indefinitely; the men who accept it verify it,Elementary Forms
41360,"by their own experience. Therefore, it could not be wholly inadequate",Elementary Forms
41360,for its subject. It is true that it may express this by means of,Elementary Forms
41360,imperfect symbols; but scientific symbols themselves are never more than,Elementary Forms
41360,approximative. It is precisely this principle which is at the basis of,Elementary Forms
41360,the method which we follow in the study of religious phenomena: we take,Elementary Forms
41360,"it as an axiom that religious beliefs, howsoever strange their",Elementary Forms
41360,"appearance may be at times, contain a truth which must be",Elementary Forms
41360,discovered.[1311],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"On the other hand, it is not at all true that concepts, even when",Elementary Forms
41360,"constructed according to the rules of science, get their authority",Elementary Forms
41360,uniquely from their objective value. It is not enough that they be true,Elementary Forms
41360,to be believed. If they are not in harmony with the other beliefs and,Elementary Forms
41360,"opinions, or, in a word, with the mass of the other collective",Elementary Forms
41360,"representations, they will be denied; minds will be closed to them;",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently it will be as though they did not exist. To-day it is,Elementary Forms
41360,generally sufficient that they bear the stamp of science to receive a,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort of privileged credit, because we have faith in science. But this",Elementary Forms
41360,faith does not differ essentially from religious faith. In the last,Elementary Forms
41360,"resort, the value which we attribute to science depends upon the idea",Elementary Forms
41360,which we collectively form of its nature and role in life; that is as,Elementary Forms
41360,much as to say that it expresses a state of public opinion. In all,Elementary Forms
41360,"social life, in fact, science rests upon opinion. It is undoubtedly true",Elementary Forms
41360,that this opinion can be taken as the object of a study and a science,Elementary Forms
41360,made of it; this is what sociology principally consists in. But the,Elementary Forms
41360,science of opinion does not make opinions; it can only observe them and,Elementary Forms
41360,make them more conscious of themselves. It is true that by this means it,Elementary Forms
41360,"can lead them to change, but science continues to be dependent upon",Elementary Forms
41360,"opinion at the very moment when it seems to be making its laws; for, as",Elementary Forms
41360,"we have already shown, it is from opinion that it holds the force",Elementary Forms
41360,necessary to act upon opinion.[1312],Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Saying that concepts express the manner in which society represents,Elementary Forms
41360,things is also saying that conceptual thought is coeval with humanity,Elementary Forms
41360,itself. We refuse to see in it the product of a more or less retarded,Elementary Forms
41360,"culture. A man who did not think with concepts would not be a man, for",Elementary Forms
41360,he would not be a social being. If reduced to having only individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"perceptions, he would be indistinguishable from the beasts. If it has",Elementary Forms
41360,"been possible to sustain the contrary thesis, it is because concepts",Elementary Forms
41360,have been defined by characteristics which are not essential to them.,Elementary Forms
41360,They have been identified with general ideas[1313] and with clearly,Elementary Forms
41360,limited and circumscribed general ideas.[1314] In these conditions it,Elementary Forms
41360,has possibly seemed as though the inferior societies had no concepts,Elementary Forms
41360,properly so called; for they have only rudimentary processes of,Elementary Forms
41360,generalization and the ideas which they use are not generally very well,Elementary Forms
41360,defined. But the greater part of our concepts are equally indetermined;,Elementary Forms
41360,we force ourselves to define them only in discussions or when doing,Elementary Forms
41360,careful work. We have also seen that conceiving is not generalizing.,Elementary Forms
41360,Thinking conceptually is not simply isolating and grouping together the,Elementary Forms
41360,common characteristics of a certain number of objects; it is relating,Elementary Forms
41360,"the variable to the permanent, the individual to the social. And since",Elementary Forms
41360,"logical thought commences with the concept, it follows that it has",Elementary Forms
41360,always existed; there is no period in history when men have lived in a,Elementary Forms
41360,"chronic confusion and contradiction. To be sure, we cannot insist too",Elementary Forms
41360,much upon the different characteristics which logic presents at,Elementary Forms
41360,different periods in history; it develops like the societies themselves.,Elementary Forms
41360,"But howsoever real these differences may be, they should not cause us to",Elementary Forms
41360,"neglect the similarities, which are no less essential.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,IV,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,We are now in a position to take up a final question which has already,Elementary Forms
41360,been raised in our introduction[1315] and which has been taken as,Elementary Forms
41360,understood in the remainder of this work. We have seen that at least,Elementary Forms
41360,some of the categories are social things. The question is where they got,Elementary Forms
41360,this character.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Undoubtedly it will be easily understood that since they are themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,"concepts, they are the work of the group. It can even be said that there",Elementary Forms
41360,are no other concepts which present to an equal degree the signs by,Elementary Forms
41360,"which a collective representation is recognized. In fact, their",Elementary Forms
41360,stability and impersonality are such that they have often passed as,Elementary Forms
41360,"being absolutely universal and immutable. Also, as they express the",Elementary Forms
41360,"fundamental conditions for an agreement between minds, it seems evident",Elementary Forms
41360,that they have been elaborated by society.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But the problem concerning them is more complex, for they are social in",Elementary Forms
41360,"another sense and, as it were in the second degree. They not only come",Elementary Forms
41360,"from society, but the things which they express are of a social nature.",Elementary Forms
41360,"Not only is it society which has founded them, but their contents are",Elementary Forms
41360,the different aspects of the social being: the category of class was at,Elementary Forms
41360,first indistinct from the concept of the human group; it is the rhythm,Elementary Forms
41360,of social life which is at the basis of the category of time; the,Elementary Forms
41360,territory occupied by the society furnished the material for the,Elementary Forms
41360,category of space; it is the collective force which was the prototype of,Elementary Forms
41360,"the concept of efficient force, an essential element in the category of",Elementary Forms
41360,"causality. However, the categories are not made to be applied only to",Elementary Forms
41360,the social realm; they reach out to all reality. Then how is it that,Elementary Forms
41360,they have taken from society the models upon which they have been,Elementary Forms
41360,constructed?,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"It is because they are the pre-eminent concepts, which have a",Elementary Forms
41360,"preponderating part in our knowledge. In fact, the function of the",Elementary Forms
41360,categories is to dominate and envelop all the other concepts: they are,Elementary Forms
41360,permanent moulds for the mental life. Now for them to embrace such an,Elementary Forms
41360,"object, they must be founded upon a reality of equal amplitude.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Undoubtedly the relations which they express exist in an implicit way in,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual consciousnesses. The individual lives in time, and, as we",Elementary Forms
41360,"have said, he has a certain sense of temporal orientation. He is",Elementary Forms
41360,"situated at a determined point in space, and it has even been held, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"sustained with good reasons, that all sensations have something special",Elementary Forms
41360,about them.[1316] He has a feeling of resemblances; similar,Elementary Forms
41360,representations are brought together and the new representation formed,Elementary Forms
41360,by their union has a sort of generic character. We also have the,Elementary Forms
41360,sensation of a certain regularity in the order of the succession of,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena; even an animal is not incapable of this. However, all these",Elementary Forms
41360,"relations are strictly personal for the individual who recognizes them,",Elementary Forms
41360,and consequently the notion of them which he may have can in no case go,Elementary Forms
41360,beyond his own narrow horizon. The generic images which are formed in my,Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness by the fusion of similar images represent only the objects,Elementary Forms
41360,which I have perceived directly; there is nothing there which could give,Elementary Forms
41360,"me the idea of a class, that is to say, of a mould including the _whole_",Elementary Forms
41360,"group of all possible objects which satisfy the same condition. Also, it",Elementary Forms
41360,"would be necessary to have the idea of group in the first place, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,mere observations of our interior life could never awaken that in us.,Elementary Forms
41360,"But, above all, there is no individual experience, howsoever extended",Elementary Forms
41360,"and prolonged it may be, which could give a suspicion of the existence",Elementary Forms
41360,"of a whole class which would embrace every single being, and to which",Elementary Forms
41360,other classes are only co-ordinated or subordinated species. This idea,Elementary Forms
41360,"of _all_, which is at the basis of the classifications which we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"just cited, could not have come from the individual himself, who is only",Elementary Forms
41360,a part in relation to the whole and who never attains more than an,Elementary Forms
41360,infinitesimal fraction of reality. And yet there is perhaps no other,Elementary Forms
41360,category of greater importance; for as the role of the categories is to,Elementary Forms
41360,"envelop all the other concepts, the category _par excellence_ would seem",Elementary Forms
41360,to be this very concept of _totality_. The theorists of knowledge,Elementary Forms
41360,"ordinarily postulate it as if it came of itself, while it really",Elementary Forms
41360,surpasses the contents of each individual consciousness taken alone to,Elementary Forms
41360,an infinite degree.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"For the same reasons, the space which I know by my senses, of which I am",Elementary Forms
41360,"the centre and where everything is disposed in relation to me, could not",Elementary Forms
41360,"be space in general, which contains all extensions and where these are",Elementary Forms
41360,co-ordinated by personal guide-lines which are common to everybody. In,Elementary Forms
41360,"the same way, the concrete duration which I feel passing within me and",Elementary Forms
41360,with me could not give me the idea of time in general: the first,Elementary Forms
41360,expresses only the rhythm of my individual life; the second should,Elementary Forms
41360,correspond to the rhythm of a life which is not that of any individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"in particular, but in which all participate.[1317] In the same way,",Elementary Forms
41360,"finally, the regularities which I am able to conceive in the manner in",Elementary Forms
41360,which my sensations succeed one another may well have a value for me;,Elementary Forms
41360,they explain how it comes about that when I am given the first of two,Elementary Forms
41360,"phenomena whose concurrence I have observed, I tend to expect the other.",Elementary Forms
41360,But this personal state of expectation could not be confounded with the,Elementary Forms
41360,conception of a universal order of succession which imposes itself upon,Elementary Forms
41360,all minds and all events.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Since the world expressed by the entire system of concepts is the one,Elementary Forms
41360,"that society regards, society alone can furnish the most general notions",Elementary Forms
41360,with which it should be represented. Such an object can be embraced only,Elementary Forms
41360,by a subject which contains all the individual subjects within it. Since,Elementary Forms
41360,"the universe does not exist except in so far as it is thought of, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"since it is not completely thought of except by society, it takes a",Elementary Forms
41360,"place in this latter; it becomes a part of society's interior life,",Elementary Forms
41360,"while this is the totality, outside of which nothing exists. The concept",Elementary Forms
41360,of totality is only the abstract form of the concept of society: it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"the whole which includes all things, the supreme class which embraces",Elementary Forms
41360,all other classes. Such is the final principle upon which repose all,Elementary Forms
41360,these primitive classifications where beings from every realm are placed,Elementary Forms
41360,"and classified in social forms, exactly like men.[1318] But if the world",Elementary Forms
41360,"is inside of society, the space which this latter occupies becomes",Elementary Forms
41360,"confounded with space in general. In fact, we have seen how each thing",Elementary Forms
41360,"has its assigned place in social space, and the degree to which this",Elementary Forms
41360,space in general differs from the concrete expanses which we perceive is,Elementary Forms
41360,well shown by the fact that this localization is wholly ideal and in no,Elementary Forms
41360,way resembles what it would have been if it had been dictated to us by,Elementary Forms
41360,"sensuous experience alone.[1319] For the same reason, the rhythm of",Elementary Forms
41360,collective life dominates and embraces the varied rhythms of all the,Elementary Forms
41360,elementary lives from which it results; consequently the time which it,Elementary Forms
41360,expresses dominates and embraces all particular durations. It is time in,Elementary Forms
41360,general. For a long time the history of the world has been only another,Elementary Forms
41360,aspect of the history of society. The one commences with the other; the,Elementary Forms
41360,periods of the first are determined by the periods of the second. This,Elementary Forms
41360,"impersonal and total duration is measured, and the guide-lines in",Elementary Forms
41360,relation to which it is divided and organized are fixed by the movements,Elementary Forms
41360,"of concentration or dispersion of society; or, more generally, the",Elementary Forms
41360,periodical necessities for a collective renewal. If these critical,Elementary Forms
41360,"instants are generally attached to some material phenomenon, such as the",Elementary Forms
41360,regular recurrence of such or such a star or the alternation of the,Elementary Forms
41360,"seasons, it is because objective signs are necessary to make this",Elementary Forms
41360,"essentially social organization intelligible to all. In the same way,",Elementary Forms
41360,"finally, the causal relation, from the moment when it is collectively",Elementary Forms
41360,"stated by the group, becomes independent of every individual",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness; it rises above all particular minds and events. It is a,Elementary Forms
41360,law whose value depends upon no person. We have already shown how it is,Elementary Forms
41360,clearly thus that it seems to have originated.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Another reason explains why the constituent elements of the categories,Elementary Forms
41360,should have been taken from social life: it is because the relations,Elementary Forms
41360,which they express could not have been learned except in and through,Elementary Forms
41360,"society. If they are in a sense immanent in the life of an individual,",Elementary Forms
41360,"he has neither a reason nor the means for learning them, reflecting upon",Elementary Forms
41360,them and forming them into distinct ideas. In order to orient himself,Elementary Forms
41360,personally in space and to know at what moments he should satisfy his,Elementary Forms
41360,"various organic needs, he has no need of making, once and for all, a",Elementary Forms
41360,conceptual representation of time and space. Many animals are able to,Elementary Forms
41360,find the road which leads to places with which they are familiar; they,Elementary Forms
41360,come back at a proper moment without knowing any of the categories;,Elementary Forms
41360,sensations are enough to direct them automatically. They would also be,Elementary Forms
41360,"enough for men, if their sensations had to satisfy only individual",Elementary Forms
41360,needs. To recognize the fact that one thing resembles another which we,Elementary Forms
41360,"have already experienced, it is in no way necessary that we arrange them",Elementary Forms
41360,all in groups and species: the way in which similar images call up each,Elementary Forms
41360,other and unite is enough to give the feeling of resemblance. The,Elementary Forms
41360,impression that a certain thing has already been seen or experienced,Elementary Forms
41360,implies no classification. To recognize the things which we should seek,Elementary Forms
41360,"or from which we should flee, it would not be necessary to attach the",Elementary Forms
41360,"effects of the two to their causes by a logical bond, if individual",Elementary Forms
41360,conveniences were the only ones in question. Purely empirical sequences,Elementary Forms
41360,and strong connections between the concrete representations would be as,Elementary Forms
41360,sure guides for the will. Not only is it true that the animal has no,Elementary Forms
41360,"others, but also our own personal conduct frequently supposes nothing",Elementary Forms
41360,more. The prudent man is the one who has a very clear sensation of what,Elementary Forms
41360,"must be done, but which he would ordinarily be quite incapable of",Elementary Forms
41360,stating as a general law.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,It is a different matter with society. This is possible only when the,Elementary Forms
41360,"individuals and things which compose it are divided into certain groups,",Elementary Forms
41360,"that is to say, classified, and when these groups are classified in",Elementary Forms
41360,relation to each other. Society supposes a self-conscious organization,Elementary Forms
41360,which is nothing other than a classification. This organization of,Elementary Forms
41360,society naturally extends itself to the place which this occupies. To,Elementary Forms
41360,"avoid all collisions, it is necessary that each particular group have a",Elementary Forms
41360,"determined portion of space assigned to it: in other terms, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary that space in general be divided, differentiated, arranged,",Elementary Forms
41360,and that these divisions and arrangements be known to everybody. On the,Elementary Forms
41360,"other hand, every summons to a celebration, a hunt or a military",Elementary Forms
41360,"expedition implies fixed and established dates, and consequently that a",Elementary Forms
41360,"common time is agreed upon, which everybody conceives in the same",Elementary Forms
41360,"fashion. Finally, the co-operation of many persons with the same end in",Elementary Forms
41360,view is possible only when they are in agreement as to the relation,Elementary Forms
41360,"which exists between this end and the means of attaining it, that is to",Elementary Forms
41360,"say, when the same causal relation is admitted by all the co-operators",Elementary Forms
41360,"in the enterprise. It is not surprising, therefore, that social time,",Elementary Forms
41360,"social space, social classes and causality should be the basis of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"corresponding categories, since it is under their social forms that",Elementary Forms
41360,these different relations were first grasped with a certain clarity by,Elementary Forms
41360,the human intellect.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"In summing up, then, we must say that society is not at all the",Elementary Forms
41360,"illogical or a-logical, incoherent and fantastic being which it has too",Elementary Forms
41360,"often been considered. Quite on the contrary, the collective",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciousness is the highest form of the psychic life, since it is the",Elementary Forms
41360,consciousness of the consciousnesses. Being placed outside of and above,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual and local contingencies, it sees things only in their",Elementary Forms
41360,"permanent and essential aspects, which it crystallizes into communicable",Elementary Forms
41360,"ideas. At the same time that it sees from above, it sees farther; at",Elementary Forms
41360,"every moment of time, it embraces all known reality; that is why it",Elementary Forms
41360,alone can furnish the mind with the moulds which are applicable to the,Elementary Forms
41360,totality of things and which make it possible to think of them. It does,Elementary Forms
41360,not create these moulds artificially; it finds them within itself; it,Elementary Forms
41360,does nothing but become conscious of them. They translate the ways of,Elementary Forms
41360,being which are found in all the stages of reality but which appear in,Elementary Forms
41360,"their full clarity only at the summit, because the extreme complexity of",Elementary Forms
41360,the psychic life which passes there necessitates a greater development,Elementary Forms
41360,of consciousness. Attributing social origins to logical thought is not,Elementary Forms
41360,debasing it or diminishing its value or reducing it to nothing more than,Elementary Forms
41360,"a system of artificial combinations; on the contrary, it is relating it",Elementary Forms
41360,to a cause which implies it naturally. But this is not saying that the,Elementary Forms
41360,ideas elaborated in this way are at once adequate for their object. If,Elementary Forms
41360,"society is something universal in relation to the individual, it is none",Elementary Forms
41360,"the less an individuality itself, which has its own personal physiognomy",Elementary Forms
41360,and its idiosyncrasies; it is a particular subject and consequently,Elementary Forms
41360,particularizes whatever it thinks of. Therefore collective,Elementary Forms
41360,"representations also contain subjective elements, and these must be",Elementary Forms
41360,"progressively rooted out, if we are to approach reality more closely.",Elementary Forms
41360,"But howsoever crude these may have been at the beginning, the fact",Elementary Forms
41360,"remains that with them the germ of a new mentality was given, to which",Elementary Forms
41360,the individual could never have raised himself by his own efforts: by,Elementary Forms
41360,"them the way was opened to a stable, impersonal and organized thought",Elementary Forms
41360,which then had nothing to do except to develop its nature.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Also, the causes which have determined this development do not seem to",Elementary Forms
41360,be specifically different from those which gave it its initial impulse.,Elementary Forms
41360,If logical thought tends to rid itself more and more of the subjective,Elementary Forms
41360,"and personal elements which it still retains from its origin, it is not",Elementary Forms
41360,because extra-social factors have intervened; it is much rather because,Elementary Forms
41360,a social life of a new sort is developing. It is this international life,Elementary Forms
41360,which has already resulted in universalizing religious beliefs. As it,Elementary Forms
41360,"extends, the collective horizon enlarges; the society ceases to appear",Elementary Forms
41360,"as the only whole, to become a part of a much vaster one, with",Elementary Forms
41360,"indetermined frontiers, which is susceptible of advancing indefinitely.",Elementary Forms
41360,Consequently things can no longer be contained in the social moulds,Elementary Forms
41360,according to which they were primitively classified; they must be,Elementary Forms
41360,"organized according to principles which are their own, so logical",Elementary Forms
41360,organization differentiates itself from the social organization and,Elementary Forms
41360,becomes autonomous. Really and truly human thought is not a primitive,Elementary Forms
41360,fact; it is the product of history; it is the ideal limit towards which,Elementary Forms
41360,"we are constantly approaching, but which in all probability we shall",Elementary Forms
41360,never succeed in reaching.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Thus it is not at all true that between science on the one hand, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"morals and religion on the other, there exists that sort of antinomy",Elementary Forms
41360,"which has so frequently been admitted, for the two forms of human",Elementary Forms
41360,activity really come from one and the same source. Kant understood this,Elementary Forms
41360,"very well, and therefore he made the speculative reason and the",Elementary Forms
41360,practical reason two different aspects of the same faculty. According to,Elementary Forms
41360,"him, what makes their unity is the fact that the two are directed",Elementary Forms
41360,towards the universal. Rational thinking is thinking according to the,Elementary Forms
41360,laws which are imposed upon all reasonable beings; acting morally is,Elementary Forms
41360,conducting one's self according to those maxims which can be extended,Elementary Forms
41360,"without contradiction to all wills. In other words, science and morals",Elementary Forms
41360,imply that the individual is capable of raising himself above his own,Elementary Forms
41360,"peculiar point of view and of living an impersonal life. In fact, it",Elementary Forms
41360,cannot be doubted that this is a trait common to all the higher forms of,Elementary Forms
41360,"thought and action. What Kant's system does not explain, however, is the",Elementary Forms
41360,origin of this sort of contradiction which is realized in man. Why is he,Elementary Forms
41360,"forced to do violence to himself by leaving his individuality, and,",Elementary Forms
41360,"inversely, why is the impersonal law obliged to be dissipated by",Elementary Forms
41360,incarnating itself in individuals? Is it answered that there are two,Elementary Forms
41360,"antagonistic worlds in which we participate equally, the world of matter",Elementary Forms
41360,"and sense on the one hand, and the world of pure and impersonal reason",Elementary Forms
41360,on the other? That is merely repeating the question in slightly,Elementary Forms
41360,"different terms, for what we are trying to find out is why we must lead",Elementary Forms
41360,"these two existences at the same time. Why do these two worlds, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"seem to contradict each other, not remain outside of each other, and why",Elementary Forms
41360,must they mutually penetrate one another in spite of their antagonism?,Elementary Forms
41360,The only explanation which has ever been given of this singular,Elementary Forms
41360,"necessity is the hypothesis of the Fall, with all the difficulties which",Elementary Forms
41360,"it implies, and which need not be repeated here. On the other hand, all",Elementary Forms
41360,mystery disappears the moment that it is recognized that impersonal,Elementary Forms
41360,reason is only another name given to collective thought. For this is,Elementary Forms
41360,"possible only through a group of individuals; it supposes them, and in",Elementary Forms
41360,"their turn, they suppose it, for they can continue to exist only by",Elementary Forms
41360,grouping themselves together. The kingdom of ends and impersonal truths,Elementary Forms
41360,"can realize itself only by the co-operation of particular wills, and the",Elementary Forms
41360,reasons for which these participate in it are the same as those for,Elementary Forms
41360,"which they co-operate. In a word, there is something impersonal in us",Elementary Forms
41360,"because there is something social in all of us, and since social life",Elementary Forms
41360,"embraces at once both representations and practices, this impersonality",Elementary Forms
41360,naturally extends to ideas as well as to acts.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Perhaps some will be surprised to see us connect the most elevated forms,Elementary Forms
41360,"of thought with society: the cause appears quite humble, in",Elementary Forms
41360,consideration of the value which we attribute to the effect. Between the,Elementary Forms
41360,"world of the senses and appetites on the one hand, and that of reason",Elementary Forms
41360,"and morals on the other, the distance is so considerable that the second",Elementary Forms
41360,would seem to have been able to add itself to the first only by a,Elementary Forms
41360,creative act. But attributing to society this preponderating role in the,Elementary Forms
41360,genesis of our nature is not denying this creation; for society has a,Elementary Forms
41360,"creative power which no other observable being can equal. In fact, all",Elementary Forms
41360,"creation, if not a mystical operation which escapes science and",Elementary Forms
41360,"knowledge, is the product of a synthesis. Now if the synthesis of",Elementary Forms
41360,particular conceptions which take place in each individual consciousness,Elementary Forms
41360,"are already and of themselves productive of novelties, how much more",Elementary Forms
41360,efficacious these vast syntheses of complete consciousnesses which make,Elementary Forms
41360,society must be! A society is the most powerful combination of physical,Elementary Forms
41360,and moral forces of which nature offers us an example. Nowhere else is,Elementary Forms
41360,"an equal richness of different materials, carried to such a degree of",Elementary Forms
41360,"concentration, to be found. Then it is not surprising that a higher life",Elementary Forms
41360,"disengages itself which, by reacting upon the elements of which it is",Elementary Forms
41360,"the product, raises them to a higher plane of existence and transforms",Elementary Forms
41360,them.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,Thus sociology appears destined to open a new way to the science of man.,Elementary Forms
41360,"Up to the present, thinkers were placed before this double alternative:",Elementary Forms
41360,either explain the superior and specific faculties of men by connecting,Elementary Forms
41360,"them to the inferior forms of his being, the reason to the senses, or",Elementary Forms
41360,"the mind to matter, which is equivalent to denying their uniqueness; or",Elementary Forms
41360,else attach them to some super-experimental reality which was,Elementary Forms
41360,"postulated, but whose existence could be established by no observation.",Elementary Forms
41360,What put them in this difficulty was the fact that the individual passed,Elementary Forms
41360,as being the _finis naturae_--the ultimate creation of nature; it seemed,Elementary Forms
41360,"that there was nothing beyond him, or at least nothing that science",Elementary Forms
41360,could touch. But from the moment when it is recognized that above the,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual there is society, and that this is not a nominal being",Elementary Forms
41360,"created by reason, but a system of active forces, a new manner of",Elementary Forms
41360,explaining men becomes possible. To conserve his distinctive traits it,Elementary Forms
41360,"is no longer necessary to put them outside experience. At least, before",Elementary Forms
41360,"going to this last extremity, it would be well to see if that which",Elementary Forms
41360,"surpasses the individual, though it is within him, does not come from",Elementary Forms
41360,this super-individual reality which we experience in society. To be,Elementary Forms
41360,"sure, it cannot be said at present to what point these explanations may",Elementary Forms
41360,"be able to reach, and whether or not they are of a nature to resolve all",Elementary Forms
41360,the problems. But it is equally impossible to mark in advance a limit,Elementary Forms
41360,beyond which they cannot go. What must be done is to try the hypothesis,Elementary Forms
41360,and submit it as methodically as possible to the control of facts. This,Elementary Forms
41360,is what we have tried to do.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[14] This hypothesis has already been set forth by the founders,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[15] Even in the theory of Spencer, it is by individual experience that",Elementary Forms

41360,"origin in the experience of the individual. According to this theory,",Elementary Forms
41360,"also, the necessity with which the categories actually impose themselves",Elementary Forms

41360,[16] Perhaps some will be surprised that we do not define the apriorist,Elementary Forms

41360,a secondary part in the doctrine. It is a simple way of stating the,Elementary Forms
41360,impossibility of reducing rational knowledge to empirical data. Saying,Elementary Forms
41360,that the former is innate is only a positive way of saying that it is,Elementary Forms
41360,"not the product of experience, such as it is ordinarily conceived.",Elementary Forms

41360,"upon it; in the same way, if the psychic nature of the individual were",Elementary Forms
41360,"absolutely opposed to the social life, society would be impossible. A",Elementary Forms
41360,complete analysis of the categories should seek these germs of,Elementary Forms
41360,rationality even in the individual consciousness. We shall have occasion,Elementary Forms
41360,to come back to this point in our conclusion. All that we wish to,Elementary Forms
41360,establish here is that between these indistinct germs of reason and the,Elementary Forms
41360,"reason properly so called, there is a difference comparable to that",Elementary Forms
41360,which separates the properties of the mineral elements out of which a,Elementary Forms
41360,living being is composed from the characteristic attributes of life,Elementary Forms
41360,after this has once been constituted.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[19] It has frequently been remarked that social disturbances result in,Elementary Forms
41360,multiplying mental disturbances. This is one more proof that logical,Elementary Forms
41360,discipline is a special aspect of social discipline. The first gives way,Elementary Forms
41360,as the second is weakened.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[20] There is an analogy between this logical necessity and moral,Elementary Forms
41360,obligation but there is not an actual identity. To-day society treats,Elementary Forms
41360,criminals in a different fashion than subjects whose intelligence only,Elementary Forms
41360,is abnormal; that is a proof that the authority attached to logical,Elementary Forms
41360,"rules and that inherent in moral rules are not of the same nature, in",Elementary Forms
41360,spite of certain similarities. They are two species of the same class.,Elementary Forms
41360,It would be interesting to make a study on the nature and origin of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"difference, which is probably not primitive, for during a long time, the",Elementary Forms
41360,public conscience has poorly distinguished between the deranged and the,Elementary Forms
41360,delinquent. We confine ourselves to signalizing this question. By this,Elementary Forms
41360,"example, one may see the number of problems which are raised by the",Elementary Forms
41360,analysis of these notions which generally pass as being elementary and,Elementary Forms
41360,"simple, but which are really of an extreme complexity.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[21] This question will be treated again in the conclusion of this work.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[22] The rationalism which is imminent in the sociological theory of,Elementary Forms
41360,knowledge is thus midway between the classical empiricism and apriorism.,Elementary Forms
41360,"For the first, the categories are purely artificial constructions; for",Elementary Forms
41360,"the second, on the contrary, they are given by nature; for us, they are",Elementary Forms
41360,"in a sense a work of art, but of an art which imitates nature with a",Elementary Forms
41360,perfection capable of increasing unlimitedly.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[23] For example, that which is at the foundation of the category of",Elementary Forms
41360,time is the rhythm of social life; but if there is a rhythm in,Elementary Forms
41360,"collective life, one may rest assured that there is another in the life",Elementary Forms
41360,"of the individual, and more generally, in that of the universe. The",Elementary Forms
41360,first is merely more marked and apparent than the others. In the same,Elementary Forms
41360,"way, we shall see that the notion of class is founded on that of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"human group. But if men form natural groups, it can be assumed that",Elementary Forms
41360,among things there exists groups which are at once analogous and,Elementary Forms
41360,different. Classes and species are natural groups of things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,If it seems to many minds that a social origin cannot be attributed to,Elementary Forms
41360,"the categories without depriving them of all speculative value, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,because society is still too frequently regarded as something that is,Elementary Forms
41360,not natural; hence it is concluded that the representations which,Elementary Forms
41360,express it express nothing in nature. But the conclusion is not worth,Elementary Forms
41360,more than the premise.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[24] This is how it is legitimate to compare the categories to tools;,Elementary Forms
41360,"for on its side, a tool is material accumulated capital. There is a",Elementary Forms
41360,"close relationship between the three ideas of tool, category and",Elementary Forms
41360,institution.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[25] We have already attempted to define religious phenomena in a paper,Elementary Forms
41360,"which was published in the _Annee Sociologique_ (Vol. II, pp. 1 ff.).",Elementary Forms
41360,"The definition then given differs, as will be seen, from the one we give",Elementary Forms

41360,"contrary, the second is not the projection of the first into individual",Elementary Forms
41360,"consciences. The problem will be directly attacked below (Bk. II, ch. v,",Elementary Forms
41360,"Sec. 2, cf. the same book, ch. vi and vii, Sec. 1). For the moment, we confine",Elementary Forms
41360,ourselves to remarking that the individual cult is presented to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"observer as an element of, and something dependent upon, the collective",Elementary Forms
41360,cult.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[92] It is by this that our present definition is connected to the one,Elementary Forms
41360,we have already proposed in the _Annee Sociologique_. In this other,Elementary Forms
41360,"work, we defined religious beliefs exclusively by their obligatory",Elementary Forms
41360,"character; but, as we shall show, this obligation evidently comes from",Elementary Forms
41360,the fact that these beliefs are the possession of a group which imposes,Elementary Forms
41360,them upon its members. The two definitions are thus in a large part the,Elementary Forms
41360,"same. If we have thought it best to propose a new one, it is because the",Elementary Forms
41360,"first was too formal, and neglected the contents of the religious",Elementary Forms
41360,"representations too much. It will be seen, in the discussions which",Elementary Forms
41360,"follow, how important it is to put this characteristic into evidence at",Elementary Forms
41360,"once. Moreover, if their imperative character is really a distinctive",Elementary Forms
41360,"trait of religious beliefs, it allows of an infinite number of degrees;",Elementary Forms
41360,consequently there are even cases where it is not easily perceptible.,Elementary Forms
41360,Hence come difficulties and embarrassments which are avoided by,Elementary Forms
41360,substituting for this criterium the one we now employ.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[93] We thus leave aside here those theories which, in whole or in part,",Elementary Forms
41360,make use of super-experimental data. This is the case with the theory,Elementary Forms
41360,"which Andrew Lang exposed in his book, _The Making of Religion_, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"which Father Schmidt has taken up again, with variations of detail, in a",Elementary Forms
41360,"series of articles on _The Origin of the Idea of God_ (_Anthropos_,",Elementary Forms
41360,"1908, 1909). Lang does not set animism definitely aside, but in the last",Elementary Forms

41360,if we do not consider it necessary to expose and discuss this conception,Elementary Forms
41360,"in the present chapter, we do not intend to pass it over in silence; we",Elementary Forms
41360,"shall come to it again below, when we shall ourselves explain the facts",Elementary Forms
41360,"upon which it is founded (Bk. II, ch. ix, Sec. 4).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,"their waking are with the living"" (_Primitive Culture_, I, p. 443). In",Elementary Forms

41360,"observer: ""_All their dreams_ are construed into visits from the spirits",Elementary Forms
41360,"of their deceased friends"" (_ibid._, p. 443). This statement is",Elementary Forms
41360,certainly exaggerated; but it is one more proof of the frequency of,Elementary Forms
41360,mystic dreams among the primitives. The etymology which Strehlow,Elementary Forms
41360,"proposes for the Arunta word _altjirerama_, which means ""to dream,"" also",Elementary Forms
41360,"tends to confirm this theory. This word is composed of _altjira_, which",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow translates by ""god"" and _rama_, which means ""see."" Thus a",Elementary Forms
41360,dream would be the moment when a man is in relations with sacred beings,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[113] Andrew Lang, who also refuses to admit that the idea of the soul",Elementary Forms
41360,"was suggested to men by their dream experiences, believes that he can",Elementary Forms
41360,derive it from other empirical data: these are the data of spiritualism,Elementary Forms
41360,"(telepathy, distance-seeing, etc.). We do not consider it necessary to",Elementary Forms
41360,discuss the theory such as it has been exposed in his book _The Making,Elementary Forms
41360,of Religion_. It reposes upon the hypothesis that spiritualism is a fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"of constant observation, and that distance-seeing is a real faculty of",Elementary Forms
41360,"men, or at least of certain men, but it is well known how much this",Elementary Forms
41360,theory is scientifically contested. What is still more contestable is,Elementary Forms
41360,that the facts of spiritualism are apparent enough and of a sufficient,Elementary Forms
41360,frequency to have been able to serve as the basis for all the religious,Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs and practices which are connected with souls and spirits. The,Elementary Forms
41360,examination of these questions would carry us too far from what is the,Elementary Forms
41360,object of our study. It is still less necessary to engage ourselves in,Elementary Forms

41360,"projected it into things. But, he adds, the fact that nature has been",Elementary Forms

41360,"manifested outside the consciousness"" (_Ecclesiastical Institutions_, Sec.",Elementary Forms
41360,659). Spencer understands by this that the notion of force in general is,Elementary Forms
41360,the sentiment of the force which we have extended to the entire,Elementary Forms

41360,with spirits analogous to our own. But even if this hypothesis in regard,Elementary Forms

41360,"requires important reservations which we shall make (Bk. III, ch. iii, Sec.",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[173] Max Mueller involuntarily recognizes this in certain passages. He,Elementary Forms

41360,natural and profane. The fact that religion represents the causes thus,Elementary Forms

41360,[212] Thus the individual totemism of America will aid us in,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[216] It may be said in a general way that the clan is a family group,",Elementary Forms

41360,"to treat them separately. Also, the primitive family organization cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,be understood before the primitive religious beliefs are known; for the,Elementary Forms
41360,latter serve as the basis of the former. This is why it is necessary to,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[241] According to Spencer and Gillen (Nat. Tr., pp. 123 ff.), the soul",Elementary Forms

41360,"becomes the soul of the child; according to Strehlow (II, pp. 51 ff.),",Elementary Forms
41360,"the conception, though being the work of the ancestor, does not imply",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[243] It is in large part the locality where the mother believes that,Elementary Forms

41360,"shall see, has its centre and the ancestors preferably frequent the",Elementary Forms
41360,places serving as centres for their respective totems. The totem of the,Elementary Forms
41360,child is therefore that which belongs to the place where the mother,Elementary Forms
41360,believes that she conceived. As this should generally be in the vicinity,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the place which serves as totemic centre for her husband, the child",Elementary Forms
41360,should generally follow the totem of his father. It is undoubtedly this,Elementary Forms
41360,which explains why the greater part of the inhabitants of a given,Elementary Forms

41360,is found in the two phratries equally. This fact seems doubtful to us.,Elementary Forms
41360,It is very possible that the two clans may have two varieties of,Elementary Forms

41360,"which a sort of secondary concubinage is allowed (Spencer and Gillen,",Elementary Forms
41360,"_Nor. Tr._, p. 106). It is the same with certain tribes of four classes.",Elementary Forms
41360,Each class has a choice between the two classes of the other phratry.,Elementary Forms
41360,"This is the case with the Kabi (see Mathews, _in_ Curr, III, 162).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[258] See Roth, _Ethnological Studies among the North-West-Central",Elementary Forms

41360,"Tribes_, _J.A.I._, XIII (1884), pp. 302 ff.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[259] Nevertheless, some tribes are cited where the matrimonial classes",Elementary Forms
41360,bear the names of animals or plants: this is the case with the Kabi,Elementary Forms
41360,"(Mathew, _Two Representative Tribes_, p. 150), the tribes observed by",Elementary Forms
41360,Mrs. Bates (_The Marriage Laws and Customs of the West Australian,Elementary Forms
41360,"Aborigines_, in _Victorian Geographical Journal_, XXIII-XXIV, p. 47),",Elementary Forms
41360,and perhaps in two tribes observed by Palmer. But these facts are very,Elementary Forms
41360,"rare and their significance badly established. Also, it is not",Elementary Forms
41360,"surprising that the classes, as well as the sexual groups, should",Elementary Forms
41360,sometimes adopt the names of animals. This exceptional extension of the,Elementary Forms
41360,totemic denominations in no way modifies our conception of totemism.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[260] Perhaps the same explanation is applicable to certain other tribes,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the South-East and the East where, if we are to believe the informers",Elementary Forms
41360,"of Howitt, totems specially attached to each matrimonial class are to be",Elementary Forms
41360,"found. This is the case among the Wiradjuri, the Wakelbura and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Bunta-Murra on the Bulloo River (Howitt, _Nat. Tr._, pp. 210, 221, 226).",Elementary Forms
41360,"However, the evidence collected is suspect, according to his own",Elementary Forms
41360,"admission. In fact, it appears from the lists which he has drawn up,",Elementary Forms
41360,that many totems are found equally in the two classes of the same,Elementary Forms
41360,phratry.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The explanation which we propose, after Frazer (_Totemism and Exogamy_,",Elementary Forms
41360,"pp. 531 ff.), raises one difficulty. In principle, each clan and",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently each totem, is represented equally in the two classes of a",Elementary Forms
41360,"single phratry, since one of the classes is that of the children and the",Elementary Forms
41360,other that of the parents from whom the former get their totems. So when,Elementary Forms
41360,"the clans disappeared, the totemic interdictions which survived should",Elementary Forms
41360,"have remained in both matrimonial classes, while in the actual cases",Elementary Forms
41360,"cited, each class has its own. Whence comes this differentiation? The",Elementary Forms
41360,example of the Kaiabara (a tribe of southern Queensland) allows us to,Elementary Forms
41360,"see how it may have come about. In this tribe, the children have the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totem of their mother, but it is particularized by some distinctive",Elementary Forms
41360,"mark. If the mother has the black eagle-hawk as totem, the child has the",Elementary Forms
41360,"white eagle-hawk (Howitt, _Nat. Tr._, p. 229). This appears to be the",Elementary Forms
41360,beginning of a tendency for the totems to differentiate themselves,Elementary Forms
41360,according to the matrimonial classes.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[261] A tribe of only a few hundred members frequently has fifty or,Elementary Forms
41360,"sixty clans, or even many more. On this point, see Durkheim and Mauss,",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[267] Among the Haida at least, the totem of the real clans is altered",Elementary Forms

41360,"clan has a number of totems, some of which it has in common with other",Elementary Forms
41360,"clans (see Swanton, pp. 107 and 268). Since Swanton calls the phratries",Elementary Forms

41360,Africa are divided into a certain number of clans; there are the people,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the crocodile, the buffalo, the monkey, etc. Now the crocodile",Elementary Forms

41360,"Arabs (_Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia_, pp. 212-214).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[304] However, according to Spencer and Gillen, there are some which",Elementary Forms
41360,"have no religious sense (see _Nat. Tr._, pp. 41 f.; _Nor. Tr._, pp. 45,",Elementary Forms
41360,54-56).,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[305] Among the Arunta, this rule has exceptions which will be explained",Elementary Forms

41360,"292, 295 f.; Schulze, _loc. cit._, p. 221. The thing thus represented is",Elementary Forms
41360,"not always the totem itself, but one of those things which, being",Elementary Forms
41360,"associated to this totem, are regarded as being in the same family of",Elementary Forms
41360,things.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[307] This is the case, for example, among the Warramunga, the Walpari,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Wulmala, the Tjingilli, the Umbaia and the Unmatjera (_Nor. Tr._,",Elementary Forms
41360,"339, 348). Among the Warramunga, at the moment when the design is",Elementary Forms
41360,"executed, the performers address the initiated with the following words:",Elementary Forms
41360,"""That mark belongs to your place; do not look out along another place.""",Elementary Forms
41360,"""This means,"" say Spencer and Gillen, ""that the young man must not",Elementary Forms
41360,interfere with ceremonies belonging to other totems than his own: it,Elementary Forms
41360,also indicates the very close association which is supposed to exist,Elementary Forms
41360,between a man and his totem and any spot especially connected with the,Elementary Forms
41360,"totem"" (_Nor. Tr._, p. 584 and n.). Among the Warramunga, the totem is",Elementary Forms
41360,"transmitted from father to child, so each locality has its own.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[308] Spencer and Gillen, _Nat. Tr._, pp. 215, 241, 376.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[309] It will be remembered (see above, p. 107) that in this tribe, the",Elementary Forms
41360,"child may have a different totem than his father, his mother, or his",Elementary Forms
41360,relatives in general. Now the relatives on both sides are the performers,Elementary Forms
41360,"designated for the ceremonies of initiation. Consequently, since in",Elementary Forms
41360,principle a man can have the quality of performer or officiant only for,Elementary Forms
41360,"the ceremonies of his own totem, it follows that in certain cases the",Elementary Forms
41360,rites by which the young man is initiated must be in connection with a,Elementary Forms
41360,totem that is not his own. That is why the paintings made on the body of,Elementary Forms
41360,the novice do not necessarily represent his own totem: cases of this,Elementary Forms
41360,"sort will be found in Spencer and Gillen, _Nat. Tr._, p. 229. That there",Elementary Forms
41360,is an anomaly here is well shown by the fact that the circumcision falls,Elementary Forms
41360,"to the totem which predominates in the local group of the initiate, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"is to say, to the one which would be the totem of the initiate himself,",Elementary Forms
41360,"if the totemic organization were not disturbed, if among the Arunta it",Elementary Forms
41360,"were what it is among the Warramunga (see Spencer and Gillen, _ibid._,",Elementary Forms
41360,p. 219).,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"The same disturbance has had another consequence. In a general way, its",Elementary Forms
41360,effect is to extend a little the bonds attaching each totem to a special,Elementary Forms
41360,"group, since each totem may have members in all the local groups",Elementary Forms
41360,"possible, and even in the two phratries. The idea that these ceremonies",Elementary Forms
41360,of a totem might be celebrated by an individual of another totem--an,Elementary Forms
41360,"idea which is contrary to the very principles of totemism, as we shall",Elementary Forms
41360,see better after a while--has thus been accepted without too much,Elementary Forms
41360,resistance. It has been admitted that a man to whom a spirit revealed,Elementary Forms
41360,"the formula for a ceremony had the right of presiding over it, even when",Elementary Forms
41360,"he was not of the totem in question himself (_Nat. Tr._, p. 519). But",Elementary Forms
41360,that this is an exception to the rule and the product of a sort of,Elementary Forms
41360,toleration is proved by the fact that the beneficiary of the formula,Elementary Forms
41360,does not have the free disposition of it; if he transmits it--and these,Elementary Forms
41360,transmissions are frequent--it can be only to a member of the totem,Elementary Forms
41360,"which the rite concerns (_Nat. Tr._, _ibid._).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,"be of another totem: as we shall see, every totem of a phratry is",Elementary Forms
41360,forbidden in a certain measure for the members of the phratry who are of,Elementary Forms
41360,a different totem.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[377] _Nor. Tr._, p. 167. We can now explain more easily how it happens",Elementary Forms
41360,"that when an interdiction is not observed, it is the other phratry which",Elementary Forms
41360,"revenges this sacrilege (see above, p. 129, n. 2). It is because it has",Elementary Forms
41360,"an interest in seeing that the rule is observed. In fact, they believe",Elementary Forms
41360,"that when the rule is broken, the totemic species may not reproduce",Elementary Forms
41360,abundantly. Now the members of the other phratry consume it regularly:,Elementary Forms
41360,therefore it is they who are affected. That is why they revenge,Elementary Forms
41360,themselves.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[378] This is the case among the Loritja (Strehlow, II, pp. 60, 61), the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Worgaia, the Warramunga, the Walpari, the Mara, the Anula and the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Binbinga (_Nor. Tr._, pp. 166, 167, 171, 173). It may be eaten by a",Elementary Forms
41360,"Warramunga or a Walpari, but only when offered by a member of the other",Elementary Forms
41360,"phratry. Spencer and Gillen remark (p. 167, n.), that in this regard the",Elementary Forms
41360,paternal and the maternal totems appear to be under different rules. It,Elementary Forms
41360,is true that in both cases the offer must come from the other phratry.,Elementary Forms
41360,"But when it is a question of the paternal totem, or the totem properly",Elementary Forms
41360,"so-called, this phratry is the one to which the totem does not belong;",Elementary Forms
41360,"for the maternal totem, the contrary is the case. Probably the principle",Elementary Forms
41360,"was first established for the former, then mechanically extended to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"other, though the situation was different. When the rule had once become",Elementary Forms
41360,established that the prohibition protecting the totem could be neglected,Elementary Forms
41360,"only on the invitation of the other phratry, it was applied also to the",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"We do not mention other interdictions mentioned by Frazer, such as those",Elementary Forms
41360,"of naming or looking at the animal or plant, for it is still less",Elementary Forms
41360,"certain that they are of totemic origin, except perhaps for certain",Elementary Forms
41360,"facts observed among the Bechuana (_Totemism_, pp. 12-13). Frazer admits",Elementary Forms
41360,"too readily--and in this regard, he has imitators--that the prohibitions",Elementary Forms
41360,against eating or touching an animal depend upon totemic beliefs.,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, there is one case in Australia, where the sight of the animal",Elementary Forms
41360,"seems to be forbidden. According to Strehlow (II, p. 59), among the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Arunta and the Loritja, a man who has the moon as totem must not look at",Elementary Forms
41360,"it very long, or he would be likely to die at the hand of an enemy. But",Elementary Forms
41360,"we believe that this is a unique case. We must not forget, also, that",Elementary Forms
41360,"astronomical totems were probably not primitive in Australia, so this",Elementary Forms
41360,prohibition may be the product of a complex elaboration. This hypothesis,Elementary Forms
41360,"is confirmed by the fact that among the Euahlayi, looking at the moon is",Elementary Forms
41360,"forbidden to all mothers and children, no matter what their totems may",Elementary Forms
41360,"be (L. Parker, _The Euahlayi_, p. 53).",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,"Tr._, p. 770).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[449] So Thomas has wrongly urged against our theory of the origin of,Elementary Forms
41360,the phratries its inability to explain their opposition (_Kinship and,Elementary Forms
41360,"Marriage_, p. 69). We do not believe that it is necessary to connect",Elementary Forms
41360,"this opposition to that of the profane and the sacred (see Hertz, _La",Elementary Forms
41360,"preeminence de la main droite_, in the _Revue Philosophique_, Dec.,",Elementary Forms
41360,"1909, p. 559). The things of one phratry are not profane for the other;",Elementary Forms
41360,"both are a part of the same religious system (see below, p. 155).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[450] For example, the clan of the Tea-tree includes the grasses, and",Elementary Forms
41360,"consequently herbivorous animals (see _Kamilaroi and Kurnai_, p. 169).",Elementary Forms
41360,This is undoubtedly the explanation of a particularity of the totemic,Elementary Forms
41360,"emblems of North America pointed out by Boas. ""Among the Tlinkit,"" he",Elementary Forms
41360,"says, ""and all the other tribes of the coast, the emblem of a group",Elementary Forms

41360,"Advancement of Science_, p. 25).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[451] Thus, among the Arunta, frogs are connected with the totem of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"gum-tree, because they are frequently found in the cavities of this",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[452] One of the signs of this primitive lack of distinction is that,Elementary Forms
41360,territorial bases are sometimes assigned to the classes just as to the,Elementary Forms

41360,the group: this is notably the case with the Wakelbura. It is to be,Elementary Forms
41360,"remembered that in this society, it is the matrimonial classes that",Elementary Forms
41360,"serve as the framework of the classification (see above, p. 144). Not",Elementary Forms
41360,only are the men of one class allowed to eat the animals attributed to,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,But we must not conclude from this that these animals are considered,Elementary Forms

41360,"the privilege of eating them, but that he is compelled to do so, for he",Elementary Forms

41360,impossible to see how this deviation came about. We have seen above (p.,Elementary Forms

41360,"Perhaps, under the influence of special circumstances, this aspect of",Elementary Forms

41360,"the mythical period, the principal totem itself was consumed by the",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,[484] Thus it comes about that the clan has frequently been confounded,Elementary Forms
41360,"with the tribe. This confusion, which frequently introduces trouble into",Elementary Forms
41360,"the writings of ethnologists, has been made especially by Curr (I, pp.",Elementary Forms
41360,61 ff.).,Elementary Forms

41360,"tribal totem in this case, for it does not follow from the fact that the",Elementary Forms
41360,free consumption of an animal is forbidden that this is a totem. Other,Elementary Forms
41360,causes can also give rise to an interdiction. The religious unity of the,Elementary Forms

41360,"totem, which he inherits from his mother"" (_Journ. and Proc. of the Roy.",Elementary Forms

41360,"[563] Wundt, who has revived the theory of Tylor in its essential lines,",Elementary Forms
41360,has tried to explain this mysterious relationship of the man and the,Elementary Forms
41360,animal in a different way: it was the sight of the corpse in,Elementary Forms
41360,decomposition which suggested the idea. When they saw worms coming out,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the body, they thought that the soul was incarnate in them and",Elementary Forms
41360,"escaped with them. Worms, and by extension, reptiles (snakes, lizards,",Elementary Forms
41360,"etc.), were therefore the first animals to serve as receptacles for the",Elementary Forms
41360,"souls of the dead, and consequently they were also the first to be",Elementary Forms
41360,venerated and to play the role of totems. It was only subsequently that,Elementary Forms
41360,other animals and plants and even inanimate objects were elevated to the,Elementary Forms
41360,same dignity. But this hypothesis does not have even the shadow of a,Elementary Forms
41360,"proof. Wundt affirms (_Mythus und Religion_, II, p. 296) that reptiles",Elementary Forms
41360,"are much more common totems than other animals; from this, he concludes",Elementary Forms
41360,that they are the most primitive. But we cannot see what justifies this,Elementary Forms
41360,"assertion, in the support of which the author cites no facts. The lists",Elementary Forms
41360,of totems gathered either in Australia or in America do not show that,Elementary Forms
41360,any special species of animal has played a preponderating role. Totems,Elementary Forms
41360,"vary from one region to another with the flora and fauna. Moreover, if",Elementary Forms
41360,"the circle of possible totems was so closely limited at first, we cannot",Elementary Forms
41360,see how totemism was able to satisfy the fundamental principle which,Elementary Forms

41360,"and distinguished from the facts of individual psychology, it has been",Elementary Forms
41360,"assumed that according to our opinion, physical constraint is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"essential thing for social life. As a matter of fact, we have never",Elementary Forms
41360,considered it more than the material and apparent expression of an,Elementary Forms
41360,interior and profound fact which is wholly ideal: this is _moral,Elementary Forms
41360,authority_. The problem of sociology--if we can speak of _a_,Elementary Forms

41360,"external constraint, the different sorts of moral authority",Elementary Forms
41360,corresponding to them and in discovering the causes which have,Elementary Forms
41360,determined these latter. The particular question which we are treating,Elementary Forms
41360,"in this present work has as its principal object, the discovery of the",Elementary Forms
41360,form under which that particular variety of moral authority which is,Elementary Forms
41360,"inherent in all that is religious has been born, and out of what",Elementary Forms
41360,elements it is made. It will be seen presently that even if we do make,Elementary Forms

41360,"another aspect of the collective life, nearly opposite to the preceding",Elementary Forms

41360,"kindred, but have imagined the kinship to explain the nature of the",Elementary Forms
41360,beliefs and rites of which they were the object. The animal was,Elementary Forms

41360,"[708] See below, Bk. III, ch i, Sec. 3.",Elementary Forms

41360,clearly presents itself after death in an animal form all come from the,Elementary Forms
41360,societies where totemism is more or less perverted. This is because the,Elementary Forms
41360,idea of the soul is necessarily ambiguous wherever the totemic beliefs,Elementary Forms
41360,"are relatively pure, for totemism implies that it participate in the two",Elementary Forms
41360,kingdoms at the same time. So it cannot become either one or the other,Elementary Forms
41360,"exclusively, but takes one aspect or the other, according to the",Elementary Forms
41360,"circumstances. As totemism develops, this ambiguity becomes less",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary, while at the same time, spirits more actively demand",Elementary Forms
41360,attention. Then the marked affinities of the soul for the animal kingdom,Elementary Forms

41360,know to-day that the unity of the person is also made up of parts and,Elementary Forms

41360,[897] It still remains to be investigated how it comes that after a,Elementary Forms
41360,"certain moment in evolution, this duplication of the soul was made in",Elementary Forms
41360,the form of an individual totem rather than of a protecting ancestor.,Elementary Forms
41360,Perhaps this question has an ethnological rather than a sociological,Elementary Forms
41360,"interest. However, the manner in which this substitution was probably",Elementary Forms
41360,effected may be represented as follows.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,The individual totem commenced by playing a merely complimentary role.,Elementary Forms
41360,Those individuals who wished to acquire powers superior to those,Elementary Forms
41360,"possessed by everybody, did not and could not content themselves with",Elementary Forms
41360,the mere protection of the ancestor; so they began to look for another,Elementary Forms
41360,"assistant of the same sort. Thus it comes about that among the Euahlayi,",Elementary Forms
41360,the magicians are the only ones who have or who can procure individual,Elementary Forms
41360,"totems. As each one has a collective totem in addition, he finds himself",Elementary Forms
41360,having many souls. But there is nothing surprising in this plurality of,Elementary Forms
41360,souls: it is the condition of a superior power.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"But when collective totemism once begins to lose ground, and when the",Elementary Forms
41360,conception of the protecting ancestor consequently begins to grow dim in,Elementary Forms
41360,"the mind, another method must be found for representing the double",Elementary Forms
41360,"nature of the soul, which is still felt. The resulting idea was that,",Elementary Forms
41360,"outside of the individual soul, there was another, charged with watching",Elementary Forms
41360,over the first one. Since this protecting power was no longer,Elementary Forms
41360,"demonstrated by the very fact of birth, men found it natural to employ,",Elementary Forms
41360,"for its discovery, means analogous to those used by magicians to enter",Elementary Forms

41360,[1005] Many of the interdictions between sacred things can be traced,Elementary Forms
41360,"back, we think, to those between the sacred and the profane. This is the",Elementary Forms
41360,"case with the interdicts of age or rank. For example, in Australia,",Elementary Forms
41360,there are sacred foods which are reserved for the initiated. But these,Elementary Forms
41360,foods are not all sacred to the same degree; there is a hierarchy among,Elementary Forms
41360,them. Nor are the initiated all equal. They do not enjoy all their,Elementary Forms
41360,"religious rights from the first, but only enter step by step into the",Elementary Forms
41360,domain of religious things. They must pass through a whole series of,Elementary Forms
41360,"ranks which are conferred upon them one after another, after special",Elementary Forms
41360,trials and ceremonies; it requires months and sometimes even years to,Elementary Forms
41360,reach the highest rank. Now special foods are assigned to each of these,Elementary Forms
41360,ranks; the men of the lower ranks may not touch the foods which,Elementary Forms
41360,"rightfully belong to the men of the superior ones (see Mathews, _Ethnol.",Elementary Forms

41360,non-initiated because they are sacred; now very different causes may,Elementary Forms
41360,"confer this character. For example, as we shall presently see, the birds",Elementary Forms
41360,"which are seen on the tops of trees are reputed to be sacred, because",Elementary Forms
41360,"they are neighbours to the great god who lives in heaven. Thus, it is",Elementary Forms
41360,possible that for different reasons the flesh of certain animals has,Elementary Forms

41360,"below, only on condition that rites attenuating or expiating it precede",Elementary Forms

41360,"speak, and especially in a high voice, during ordinary life; then, in",Elementary Forms
41360,the religious life they ought to keep still or talk in a low voice. This,Elementary Forms

41360,"[1045] Since there is a sacred principle, the soul, within each man,",Elementary Forms
41360,"from the very first, the individual is surrounded by interdicts, the",Elementary Forms
41360,original form of the moral interdicts which isolate and protect the,Elementary Forms
41360,human person to-day. Thus the corpse of his victim is considered,Elementary Forms
41360,"dangerous for a murderer (Spencer and Gillen, _Nat. Tr._, p. 492), and",Elementary Forms
41360,is taboo for him. Now the interdicts having this origin are frequently,Elementary Forms
41360,used by individuals as a means of withdrawing certain things from common,Elementary Forms
41360,"use and thus establishing a property right over them. ""When a man goes",Elementary Forms
41360,"away from the camp, leaving his arms and food there,"" says Roth,",Elementary Forms
41360,"speaking of the tribes on the Palmer River (North Queensland), ""if he",Elementary Forms
41360,"urinates near the objects he leaves, they become _tami_ (equivalent to",Elementary Forms

41360,"Queensland Ethnography_, in _Records of the Australian Museum_, Vol.",Elementary Forms
41360,"VII, No. 2, p. 75). This is because the urine, like the blood, is",Elementary Forms
41360,believed to contain some of the sacred force which is personal to the,Elementary Forms
41360,"individual. So it keeps strangers at a distance. For the same reasons,",Elementary Forms
41360,the spoken word may also serve as a vehicle for these same influences;,Elementary Forms
41360,that is how it becomes possible to prevent access to an object by a mere,Elementary Forms

41360,different individuals; it is greater as their character is more sacred.,Elementary Forms
41360,Men have this privilege almost to the exclusion of women (Roth cites one,Elementary Forms
41360,single case of a taboo imposed by women); it is at its maximum with the,Elementary Forms

41360,of which contributes to his acquisition of his specific powers (see,Elementary Forms
41360,"_L'Origine des pouvoirs magiques_, in Hubert and Mauss, _Melanges",Elementary Forms
41360,"d'histoire des religions_, pp. 171, 173, 176). The same is true for the",Elementary Forms
41360,husband and wife on the day before and the day after the wedding (taboos,Elementary Forms

41360,"quite naturally, is also destined to shape the individuals for their new",Elementary Forms

41360,"sort of initiation. Thus it is explained how the initiation, on its",Elementary Forms
41360,"side, takes the form of hazing. It is because the group of old men is",Elementary Forms
41360,"superior in religious and moral dignity to that of the young men, and",Elementary Forms
41360,yet the first must assimilate the second. So all the conditions for,Elementary Forms

41360,studied is based solely on the observations of Spencer and Gillen. Since,Elementary Forms
41360,"this chapter was written, Strehlow has published the third fascicule of",Elementary Forms
41360,"his work, which deals with the positive cult and especially the",Elementary Forms
41360,"Intichiuma, or, as he says, the rites of the _mbatjalkatiuma_. But we",Elementary Forms
41360,have found nothing in this publication which obliges us to modify the,Elementary Forms
41360,preceding description or even to complete it with important additions.,Elementary Forms
41360,The most interesting thing taught by Strehlow on this subject is that,Elementary Forms
41360,the effusions and oblations of blood are much more frequent than one,Elementary Forms
41360,"would suspect from the account of Spencer and Gillen (see Strehlow, III,",Elementary Forms
41360,"pp. 13, 14, 19, 29, 39, 43, 46, 56, 67, 80, 89).",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"Moreover, the information given by Strehlow in regard to the cult must",Elementary Forms
41360,"be taken carefully, for he was not a witness of the rites he describes;",Elementary Forms
41360,"he confined himself to collecting oral testimony, which is generally",Elementary Forms
41360,"rather summary (see fasc. III, Preface of Leonhardi, p. v). It may even",Elementary Forms
41360,be asked if he has not confused the totemic ceremonies of initiation,Elementary Forms
41360,"with those which he calls _mbatjalkatiuma_, to an excessive degree. Of",Elementary Forms
41360,"course, he has made a praiseworthy attempt to distinguish them and has",Elementary Forms
41360,made two of their distinctive characteristics very evident. In the first,Elementary Forms
41360,"place, the Intichiuma always takes place at a sacred spot to which the",Elementary Forms
41360,"souvenir of some ancestor is attached, while the initiation ceremonies",Elementary Forms
41360,"may be celebrated anywhere. Secondly, the oblations of blood are special",Elementary Forms
41360,"to the Intichiuma, which proves that they are close to the heart of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual (III, p. 7). But in the description which he gives us of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rites, we find facts belonging indifferently to each species of",Elementary Forms
41360,"ceremony. In fact, in what he describes under the name mbatjalkatiuma,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the young men generally take an important part (for example, see pp. 11,",Elementary Forms
41360,"13, etc.), which is characteristic of the initiation. Also, it seems as",Elementary Forms
41360,"though the place of the rite is arbitrary, for the actors construct",Elementary Forms
41360,their scene artificially. They dig a hole into which they go; he seldom,Elementary Forms
41360,makes any allusion to sacred trees or rocks and their ritual role.,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[1139] For the second part of the ceremony as for the first, we have",Elementary Forms
41360,"followed Spencer and Gillen. On this subject, the recent fascicule of",Elementary Forms
41360,"Strehlow only confirms the observations of his predecessors, at least on",Elementary Forms
41360,all essential points. He recognizes that after the first ceremony (two,Elementary Forms
41360,"months afterwards, he says, p. 13), the chief of the clan eats the",Elementary Forms
41360,totemic animal or plant ritually and that after this he raises the,Elementary Forms
41360,interdicts; he calls this operation _die Freigabe des Totems zum,Elementary Forms
41360,"allgemeinen Gebrauch_ (III, p. 7). He even tells us that this operation",Elementary Forms
41360,is important enough to have a special word for it in the Arunta,Elementary Forms
41360,"language. He adds, it is true, that this ritual consummation is not the",Elementary Forms
41360,"only one, but that the chiefs and old men sometimes eat the sacred plant",Elementary Forms
41360,or animal before the first ceremony and that the performer of the rite,Elementary Forms
41360,does so after the celebration. The fact is not improbable; these,Elementary Forms
41360,consummations are means employed by the officiants or assistants to,Elementary Forms
41360,acquire virtues which they acquire; it is not surprising if they are,Elementary Forms
41360,numerous. It does not invalidate the account of Spencer and Gillen at,Elementary Forms
41360,"all, for the rite upon which they insist, and not without reason, is the",Elementary Forms
41360,_Freigabe des Totems_.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,On only two points does Strehlow contest the allegations of Spencer and,Elementary Forms
41360,"Gillen. In the first place, he declares that the ritual consumption does",Elementary Forms
41360,"not take place in every case. This cannot be doubted, for there are some",Elementary Forms
41360,"animals and plants which are not edible. But still, the rite is very",Elementary Forms
41360,"frequent; Strehlow himself cites numerous examples (pp. 13, 14, 19, 23,",Elementary Forms
41360,"33, 36, 50, 59, 67, 68, 71, 75, 80, 84, 89, 93). Secondly, we have seen",Elementary Forms
41360,"that according to Spencer and Gillen, if the chief does not eat the",Elementary Forms
41360,"totemic animal or plant, he will lose his powers. Strehlow assures us",Elementary Forms
41360,that the testimony of natives does not confirm this assertion. But this,Elementary Forms
41360,question seems to us to be quite secondary. The assured fact is that the,Elementary Forms
41360,"ritual consumption is required, so it must be thought useful or",Elementary Forms
41360,"necessary. Now, like every communion, it can only serve to confer needed",Elementary Forms
41360,virtues upon the person communicating. It does not follow from the fact,Elementary Forms
41360,"that the natives, or some of them, have forgotten this function of the",Elementary Forms
41360,"rite, that it is not real. Is it necessary to repeat that worshippers",Elementary Forms
41360,are generally ignorant of the real reasons for their practices?,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[1155] It should be asked, for example, whether the effusions of blood",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[1156] The expiatory rites, of which we shall speak more fully in the",Elementary Forms

41360,confounded.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[1200] Perhaps this difference is partially due to the fact that among,Elementary Forms

41360,ancestor about whom the legendary history of the clan centres. This is,Elementary Forms
41360,the ancestor whom the rite commemorates; now the officiant need not be,Elementary Forms

41360,"greatly from the Wollunqua (Strehlow, I, p. 78; cf. II, p. 71, where the",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[1207] One of the most solemn of these ceremonies is the one which we,Elementary Forms

41360,"[1208] _Nor. Tr._, pp. 227, 248.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[1209] Here are the terms of Spencer and Gillen in the only passage in,Elementary Forms
41360,which they speak of a possible connection between the Wollunqua and,Elementary Forms
41360,"rain. A few days after the rite about the hillock, ""the old men say that",Elementary Forms
41360,"they have heard Wollunqua speak, that he was satisfied with what had",Elementary Forms
41360,passed and that he was going to send rain. The reason for this prophecy,Elementary Forms
41360,"was that they, as well as ourselves, had heard thunder rolling at a",Elementary Forms
41360,"distance."" To such a slight extent is the production of rain the",Elementary Forms
41360,immediate object of the ceremony that they did not attribute it to,Elementary Forms
41360,"Wollunqua until several days later, and then after accidental",Elementary Forms
41360,circumstances. Another fact shows how vague the ideas of the natives are,Elementary Forms
41360,"on this point. A few lines below, thunder is spoken of as a sign, not of",Elementary Forms
41360,"the Wollunqua's satisfaction, but of its discontent. In spite of these",Elementary Forms
41360,"prognostics, continue our authors, ""the rain did not fall. But some days",Elementary Forms
41360,"later, they heard the thunder rolling in the distance again. The old men",Elementary Forms
41360,"said that the Wollunqua was grumbling because he was not contented"" with",Elementary Forms
41360,"the way in which the rite had been celebrated. Thus a single phenomenon,",Elementary Forms
41360,"the noise of thunder, is sometimes interpreted as a sign of a favouring",Elementary Forms
41360,"disposition, and sometimes as a mark of evil intentions.",Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"However, there is one detail of the ritual which, if we accept the",Elementary Forms
41360,"explanation of it proposed by Spencer and Gillen, is directly efficient.",Elementary Forms
41360,"According to them, the destruction of the hillock was intended to",Elementary Forms
41360,"frighten the Wollunqua and to prevent it, by magic constraint, from",Elementary Forms
41360,leaving its retreat. But this interpretation seems very doubtful to us.,Elementary Forms
41360,"In fact, in the very case of which we were speaking, where it was",Elementary Forms
41360,"announced that the Wollunqua was dissatisfied, this dissatisfaction was",Elementary Forms
41360,attributed to the fact that they had neglected to take away the debris,Elementary Forms
41360,"of the hillock. So this removal is demanded by the Wollunqua itself, and",Elementary Forms
41360,in no way intended to intimidate it and exercise a coercive influence,Elementary Forms
41360,over it. This is probably merely one case of a more general rule which,Elementary Forms
41360,is in force among the Warramunga: the instruments of the cult must be,Elementary Forms
41360,destroyed after each ceremony. Thus the ritual ornamentations with which,Elementary Forms
41360,the officiants are decorated are violently torn off from them when the,Elementary Forms
41360,"rite is terminated (_Nor. Tr._, p. 205).",Elementary Forms

41360,probably could not be found for these excesses. It is merely a,Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[1223] Here are the very words used by Spencer and Gillen: ""They (the",Elementary Forms

41360,,Elementary Forms

41360,"more appropriate for the other. But in these conditions, the error",Elementary Forms
41360,hardly seems to have the gravity attributed to it by Strehlow.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,"[1228] It cannot be otherwise. In fact, as the initiation is a tribal",Elementary Forms
41360,"feast, novices of different totems are initiated at the same time. So",Elementary Forms
41360,the ceremonies which thus succeed one another in the same place have to,Elementary Forms
41360,"do with several totems, and, therefore, they must take place away from",Elementary Forms
41360,the places with which they are connected by the myth.,Elementary Forms
41360,,Elementary Forms
41360,[1229] It will now be understood why we have never studied the,Elementary Forms
41360,initiation rites by themselves: it is because they are not a ritual,Elementary Forms
41360,"entity, but are formed by the conglomeration of rites of different",Elementary Forms
41360,"sorts. There are interdictions, ascetic rites and representative",Elementary Forms
41360,ceremonies which cannot be distinguished from those celebrated at the,Elementary Forms
41360,time of the Intichiuma. So we had to dismember this composite system and,Elementary Forms
41360,"treat each of the different rites composing it separately, classifying",Elementary Forms
41360,them with the similar rites to which they are to be related. We have,Elementary Forms
41360,also seen (pp. 285 ff.) that the initiation has served as the point of,Elementary Forms
41360,departure for a new religion which tends to surpass totemism. But it has,Elementary Forms
41360,been sufficient for us to show that totemism contained the germs of this,Elementary Forms
41360,religion; we have had no need of following out its development. The,Elementary Forms
41360,object of this book is to study the elementary beliefs and practices; so,Elementary Forms

61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose",Communist Manifesto

61,feudal society.  At a certain stage in the development of these,Communist Manifesto
61,"means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which",Communist Manifesto
61,"feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of",Communist Manifesto
61,"agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal",Communist Manifesto

61,They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a",Communist Manifesto
61,"social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the",Communist Manifesto
61,economical and political sway of the bourgeois class.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,A similar movement is going on before our own eyes.  Modern,Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange",Communist Manifesto
61,"and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic",Communist Manifesto
61,"means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is",Communist Manifesto
61,no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he,Communist Manifesto
61,has called up by his spells.  For many a decade past the history,Communist Manifesto
61,of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of,Communist Manifesto
61,"modern productive forces against modern conditions of production,",Communist Manifesto
61,against the property relations that are the conditions for the,Communist Manifesto
61,existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.  It is enough to,Communist Manifesto
61,mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put,Communist Manifesto
61,"on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the",Communist Manifesto
61,entire bourgeois society.  In these crises a great part not only,Communist Manifesto
61,"of the existing products, but also of the previously created",Communist Manifesto
61,"productive forces, are periodically destroyed.  In these crises",Communist Manifesto
61,"there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would",Communist Manifesto
61,have seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production.,Communist Manifesto
61,Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary,Communist Manifesto
61,"barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of",Communist Manifesto
61,devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;,Communist Manifesto
61,industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  Because,Communist Manifesto
61,"there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence,",Communist Manifesto
61,"too much industry, too much commerce.  The productive forces at",Communist Manifesto
61,the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development,Communist Manifesto
61,"of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they",Communist Manifesto
61,"have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are",Communist Manifesto
61,"fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring",Communist Manifesto
61,"disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the",Communist Manifesto
61,existence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois,Communist Manifesto
61,society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.,Communist Manifesto
61,And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  On the one,Communist Manifesto
61,hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the,Communist Manifesto
61,"other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough",Communist Manifesto
61,"exploitation of the old ones.  That is to say, by paving the",Communist Manifesto
61,"way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by",Communist Manifesto
61,diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the,Communist Manifesto
61,ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring,Communist Manifesto
61,death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who,Communist Manifesto
61,are to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the,Communist Manifesto
61,proletarians.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed,",Communist Manifesto
61,"in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working",Communist Manifesto
61,"class, developed--a class of labourers, who live only so long",Communist Manifesto
61,"as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour",Communist Manifesto
61,"increases capital.  These labourers, who must sell themselves",Communist Manifesto
61,"piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of",Communist Manifesto
61,"commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of",Communist Manifesto
61,"competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of,Communist Manifesto
61,"labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual",Communist Manifesto
61,"character, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  He",Communist Manifesto
61,"becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most",Communist Manifesto
61,"simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is",Communist Manifesto
61,"required of him.  Hence, the cost of production of a workman is",Communist Manifesto
61,"restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he",Communist Manifesto
61,"requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his",Communist Manifesto
61,"race.  But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of",Communist Manifesto
61,"labour, is equal to its cost of production.  In proportion",Communist Manifesto
61,"therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage",Communist Manifesto
61,"decreases.  Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and",Communist Manifesto
61,"division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden",Communist Manifesto
61,"of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working",Communist Manifesto
61,"hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by",Communist Manifesto
61,"increased speed of the machinery, etc.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the,Communist Manifesto
61,patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial,Communist Manifesto
61,"capitalist.  Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are",Communist Manifesto
61,organised like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they,Communist Manifesto
61,are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers,Communist Manifesto
61,"and sergeants.  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class,",Communist Manifesto
61,and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by,Communist Manifesto
61,"the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the",Communist Manifesto
61,individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  The more openly this,Communist Manifesto
61,"despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty,",Communist Manifesto
61,the more hateful and the more embittering it is.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual,Communist Manifesto
61,"labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes",Communist Manifesto
61,"developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of",Communist Manifesto
61,women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive,Communist Manifesto
61,social validity for the working class. All are instruments of,Communist Manifesto
61,"labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age",Communist Manifesto
61,and sex.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer,",Communist Manifesto
61,"so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is",Communist Manifesto
61,"set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord,",Communist Manifesto
61,"the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople,",Communist Manifesto
61,"shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and",Communist Manifesto
61,"peasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly",Communist Manifesto
61,because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale,Communist Manifesto
61,"on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the",Communist Manifesto
61,"competition with the large capitalists, partly because their",Communist Manifesto
61,specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of,Communist Manifesto
61,production.  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes,Communist Manifesto
61,of the population.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The proletariat goes through various stages of development.,Communist Manifesto
61,With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  At,Communist Manifesto
61,"first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by",Communist Manifesto
61,"the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade,",Communist Manifesto
61,"in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly",Communist Manifesto
61,exploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the,Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments",Communist Manifesto
61,of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that,Communist Manifesto
61,"compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they",Communist Manifesto
61,"set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished",Communist Manifesto
61,status of the workman of the Middle Ages.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass,Communist Manifesto
61,"scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual",Communist Manifesto
61,"competition.  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,",Communist Manifesto
61,"this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of",Communist Manifesto
61,"the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its",Communist Manifesto
61,"own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in",Communist Manifesto
61,"motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so.  At this",Communist Manifesto
61,"stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies,",Communist Manifesto
61,"but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute",Communist Manifesto
61,"monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty",Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie.  Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated,Communist Manifesto
61,in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a,Communist Manifesto
61,victory for the bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,But with the development of industry the proletariat not only,Communist Manifesto
61,"increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses,",Communist Manifesto
61,"its strength grows, and it feels that strength more.  The various",Communist Manifesto
61,interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the,Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as",Communist Manifesto
61,"machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly",Communist Manifesto
61,everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.  The growing,Communist Manifesto
61,"competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial",Communist Manifesto
61,"crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.  The",Communist Manifesto
61,"unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing,",Communist Manifesto
61,makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions,Communist Manifesto
61,between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and,Communist Manifesto
61,more the character of collisions between two classes.  Thereupon,Communist Manifesto
61,the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against,Communist Manifesto
61,the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of,Communist Manifesto
61,wages; they found permanent associations in order to make,Communist Manifesto
61,provision beforehand for these occasional revolts.  Here and,Communist Manifesto
61,there the contest breaks out into riots.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.",Communist Manifesto
61,"The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate",Communist Manifesto
61,"result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.  This",Communist Manifesto
61,union is helped on by the improved means of communication that,Communist Manifesto
61,are created by modern industry and that place the workers of,Communist Manifesto
61,different localities in contact with one another.  It was just,Communist Manifesto
61,this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local,Communist Manifesto
61,"struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle",Communist Manifesto
61,between classes.  But every class struggle is a political,Communist Manifesto
61,"struggle.  And that union, to attain which the burghers of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries,",Communist Manifesto
61,"the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few",Communist Manifesto
61,years.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and",Communist Manifesto
61,"consequently into a political party, is continually being upset",Communist Manifesto
61,again by the competition between the workers themselves.  But it,Communist Manifesto
61,"ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.  It compels",Communist Manifesto
61,"legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers,",Communist Manifesto
61,by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie,Communist Manifesto
61,itself.  Thus the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society,Communist Manifesto
61,"further, in many ways, the course of development of the",Communist Manifesto
61,proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant,Communist Manifesto
61,"battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those",Communist Manifesto
61,"portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become",Communist Manifesto
61,"antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the",Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees,Communist Manifesto
61,"itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its",Communist Manifesto
61,"help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its",Communist Manifesto
61,"own instruments of political and general education, in other",Communist Manifesto
61,"words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting",Communist Manifesto
61,the bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling",Communist Manifesto
61,"classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the",Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of",Communist Manifesto
61,existence.  These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements,Communist Manifesto
61,of enlightenment and progress.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive",Communist Manifesto
61,"hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling",Communist Manifesto
61,"class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a",Communist Manifesto
61,"violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling",Communist Manifesto
61,"class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the",Communist Manifesto
61,"class that holds the future in its hands.  Just as, therefore, at",Communist Manifesto
61,"an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the",Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois",Communist Manifesto
61,"ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of",Communist Manifesto
61,comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie,Communist Manifesto
61,"today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class.",Communist Manifesto
61,The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of,Communist Manifesto
61,Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential,Communist Manifesto
61,"product.  The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the",Communist Manifesto
61,"shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions",Communist Manifesto
61,"of the middle class.  They are therefore not revolutionary, but",Communist Manifesto
61,"conservative.  Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try",Communist Manifesto
61,to roll back the wheel of history.  If by chance they are,Communist Manifesto
61,"revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending",Communist Manifesto
61,"transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their",Communist Manifesto

61,"cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except",Communist Manifesto
61,"by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and",Communist Manifesto
61,thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  They,Communist Manifesto
61,have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission,Communist Manifesto
61,"is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of,",Communist Manifesto
61,individual property.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"All previous historical movements were movements of minorities,",Communist Manifesto
61,or in the interests of minorities.  The proletarian movement is,Communist Manifesto
61,"the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority,",Communist Manifesto
61,"in the interests of the immense majority.  The proletariat, the",Communist Manifesto
61,"lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise",Communist Manifesto
61,"itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official",Communist Manifesto
61,society being sprung into the air.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the",Communist Manifesto
61,proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.,Communist Manifesto
61,"The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all",Communist Manifesto
61,settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,In depicting the most general phases of the development of the,Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging",Communist Manifesto
61,"within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks",Communist Manifesto
61,"out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the",Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have",Communist Manifesto
61,"already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed",Communist Manifesto
61,"classes.  But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions",Communist Manifesto
61,"must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its",Communist Manifesto
61,"slavish existence.  The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised",Communist Manifesto
61,"himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to",Communist Manifesto
61,"develop into a bourgeois.  The modern laborer, on the contrary,",Communist Manifesto
61,"instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and",Communist Manifesto
61,deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class.  He,Communist Manifesto
61,"becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than",Communist Manifesto
61,"population and wealth.  And here it becomes evident, that the",Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in,Communist Manifesto
61,"society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society",Communist Manifesto
61,as an over-riding law.  It is unfit to rule because it is,Communist Manifesto
61,incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his,Communist Manifesto
61,"slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a",Communist Manifesto
61,"state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.",Communist Manifesto
61,"Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other",Communist Manifesto
61,"words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of",Communist Manifesto
61,"the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of",Communist Manifesto
61,capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour.  Wage-labour,Communist Manifesto
61,rests exclusively on competition between the laborers.  The,Communist Manifesto
61,"advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie,",Communist Manifesto
61,"replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition,",Communist Manifesto
61,"by their revolutionary combination, due to association.  The",Communist Manifesto
61,"development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its",Communist Manifesto
61,feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and,Communist Manifesto
61,"appropriates products.  What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces,",Communist Manifesto
61,"above all, is its own grave-diggers.  Its fall and the victory of",Communist Manifesto
61,the proletariat are equally inevitable.,Communist Manifesto

61,II.  PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a,Communist Manifesto
61,whole?,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other,Communist Manifesto
61,working-class parties.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,They have no interests separate and apart from those of the,Communist Manifesto
61,proletariat as a whole.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own,",Communist Manifesto
61,by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties,Communist Manifesto
61,by this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians,Communist Manifesto
61,"of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front",Communist Manifesto
61,"the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of",Communist Manifesto
61,all nationality.  (2) In the various stages of development which the,Communist Manifesto
61,struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass,Communist Manifesto
61,"through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the",Communist Manifesto
61,movement as a whole.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically,",Communist Manifesto
61,the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class,Communist Manifesto
61,"parties of every country, that section which pushes forward",Communist Manifesto
61,"all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over",Communist Manifesto
61,the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly,Communist Manifesto
61,"understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate",Communist Manifesto
61,general results of the proletarian movement.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all,Communist Manifesto
61,the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into,Communist Manifesto
61,"a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of",Communist Manifesto
61,political power by the proletariat.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way,Communist Manifesto
61,"based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or",Communist Manifesto
61,"discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  They",Communist Manifesto
61,"merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from",Communist Manifesto
61,"an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on",Communist Manifesto
61,under our very eyes.  The abolition of existing property,Communist Manifesto
61,relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,All property relations in the past have continually been subject,Communist Manifesto
61,to historical change consequent upon the change in historical,Communist Manifesto
61,conditions.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in",Communist Manifesto
61,favour of bourgeois property.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of,Communist Manifesto
61,"property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But",Communist Manifesto
61,modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete,Communist Manifesto
61,"expression of the system of producing and appropriating products,",Communist Manifesto
61,"that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the",Communist Manifesto
61,many by the few.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in",Communist Manifesto
61,the single sentence: Abolition of private property.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing,Communist Manifesto
61,the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a,Communist Manifesto
61,"man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork",Communist Manifesto
61,"of all personal freedom, activity and independence.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  Do you mean the",Communist Manifesto
61,"property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of",Communist Manifesto
61,property that preceded the bourgeois form?  There is no need to,Communist Manifesto
61,abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent,Communist Manifesto
61,"already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not,Communist Manifesto
61,"a bit.  It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which",Communist Manifesto
61,"exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon",Communist Manifesto
61,condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh,Communist Manifesto
61,"exploitation.  Property, in its present form, is based on the",Communist Manifesto
61,antagonism of capital and wage-labour.  Let us examine both sides,Communist Manifesto
61,of this antagonism.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a",Communist Manifesto
61,"social status in production.  Capital is a collective product,",Communist Manifesto
61,"and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last",Communist Manifesto
61,"resort, only by the united action of all members of society,",Communist Manifesto
61,can it be set in motion.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into",Communist Manifesto
61,"the property of all members of society, personal property is not",Communist Manifesto
61,thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social,Communist Manifesto
61,character of the property that is changed. It loses its,Communist Manifesto
61,class-character.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Let us now take wage-labour.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,",Communist Manifesto
61,"that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely",Communist Manifesto
61,"requisite in bare existence as a labourer.  What, therefore, the",Communist Manifesto
61,"wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely",Communist Manifesto
61,suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  We by no,Communist Manifesto
61,means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the,Communist Manifesto
61,"products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the",Communist Manifesto
61,"maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no",Communist Manifesto
61,surplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  All that we,Communist Manifesto
61,"want to do away with, is the miserable character of this",Communist Manifesto
61,"appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase",Communist Manifesto
61,"capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of",Communist Manifesto
61,the ruling class requires it.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase",Communist Manifesto
61,"accumulated labour.  In Communist society, accumulated labour",Communist Manifesto
61,"is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence",Communist Manifesto
61,of the labourer.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present;",Communist Manifesto
61,"in Communist society, the present dominates the past.  In",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality,",Communist Manifesto
61,while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,And the abolition of this state of things is called by the,Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly",Communist Manifesto
61,"so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois",Communist Manifesto
61,"independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of",Communist Manifesto
61,"production, free trade, free selling and buying.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying",Communist Manifesto
61,"disappears also.  This talk about free selling and buying, and",Communist Manifesto
61,"all the other ""brave words"" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in",Communist Manifesto
61,"general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted",Communist Manifesto
61,"selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages,",Communist Manifesto
61,but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of,Communist Manifesto
61,"buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,",Communist Manifesto
61,and of the bourgeoisie itself.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,You are horrified at our intending to do away with private,Communist Manifesto
61,"property.  But in your existing society, private property is",Communist Manifesto
61,already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its,Communist Manifesto
61,existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the,Communist Manifesto
61,"hands of those nine-tenths.  You reproach us, therefore, with",Communist Manifesto
61,"intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary",Communist Manifesto
61,condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any,Communist Manifesto
61,property for the immense majority of society.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your",Communist Manifesto
61,property.  Precisely so; that is just what we intend.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into,Communist Manifesto
61,"capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being",Communist Manifesto
61,"monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can",Communist Manifesto
61,"no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital,",Communist Manifesto
61,"from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"You must, therefore, confess that by ""individual"" you mean no",Communist Manifesto

61,"property.  This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and",Communist Manifesto
61,made impossible.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the,Communist Manifesto

61,to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who,Communist Manifesto

61,1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,A. Feudal Socialism,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the",Communist Manifesto
61,aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against,Communist Manifesto
61,"modern bourgeois society.  In the French revolution of July 1830,",Communist Manifesto
61,"and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again",Communist Manifesto
61,"succumbed to the hateful upstart.  Thenceforth, a serious political",Communist Manifesto
61,contest was altogether out of the question.  A literary battle,Communist Manifesto
61,alone remained possible.  But even in the domain of literature,Communist Manifesto
61,the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to",Communist Manifesto
61,"lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate",Communist Manifesto
61,their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the,Communist Manifesto
61,exploited working class alone.  Thus the aristocracy took their,Communist Manifesto
61,"revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering",Communist Manifesto
61,in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half",Communist Manifesto
61,"lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at",Communist Manifesto
61,"times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the",Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in,Communist Manifesto
61,"its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of",Communist Manifesto
61,modern history.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the",Communist Manifesto
61,"proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  But the people, so",Communist Manifesto
61,"often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal",Communist Manifesto
61,"coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"One section of the French Legitimists and ""Young England""",Communist Manifesto
61,exhibited this spectacle.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to,Communist Manifesto
61,"that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they",Communist Manifesto
61,exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite,Communist Manifesto
61,"different, and that are now antiquated.  In showing that, under",Communist Manifesto
61,"their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget",Communist Manifesto
61,that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their,Communist Manifesto
61,own form of society.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary",Communist Manifesto
61,character of their criticism that their chief accusation against,Communist Manifesto
61,"the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime",Communist Manifesto
61,"a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and",Communist Manifesto
61,branch the old order of society.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it,Communist Manifesto
61,"creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary",Communist Manifesto
61,proletariat.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive",Communist Manifesto
61,"measures against the working class; and in ordinary life,",Communist Manifesto
61,"despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the",Communist Manifesto
61,"golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter",Communist Manifesto
61,"truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and",Communist Manifesto
61,potato spirits.,Communist Manifesto

61,Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist,Communist Manifesto

61,Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates,Communist Manifesto
61,the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.,Communist Manifesto

61,B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by,Communist Manifesto
61,"the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence",Communist Manifesto
61,pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society.,Communist Manifesto
61,The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were,Communist Manifesto
61,the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.  In those countries,Communist Manifesto
61,"which are but little developed, industrially and commercially,",Communist Manifesto
61,these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising,Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,In countries where modern civilisation has become fully,Communist Manifesto
61,"developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,",Communist Manifesto
61,fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing,Communist Manifesto
61,itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.  The,Communist Manifesto
61,"individual members of this class, however, are being constantly",Communist Manifesto
61,"hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition,",Communist Manifesto
61,"and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment",Communist Manifesto
61,approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent,Communist Manifesto
61,"section of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures,",Communist Manifesto
61,"agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more",Communist Manifesto
61,"than half of the population, it was natural that writers who",Communist Manifesto
61,"sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,",Communist Manifesto
61,"in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these",Communist Manifesto
61,intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working,Communist Manifesto
61,class.  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.  Sismondi was the,Communist Manifesto
61,"head of this school, not only in France but also in England.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the,Communist Manifesto
61,contradictions in the conditions of modern production.  It laid,Communist Manifesto
61,"bare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  It proved,",Communist Manifesto
61,"incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and",Communist Manifesto
61,division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a,Communist Manifesto
61,few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the,Communist Manifesto
61,"inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery",Communist Manifesto
61,"of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying",Communist Manifesto
61,"inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of",Communist Manifesto
61,"extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral",Communist Manifesto
61,"bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"In its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires",Communist Manifesto
61,"either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange,",Communist Manifesto
61,"and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or",Communist Manifesto
61,"to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange,",Communist Manifesto
61,within the framework of the old property relations that have,Communist Manifesto
61,"been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  In either",Communist Manifesto
61,"case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture,",Communist Manifesto
61,patriarchal relations in agriculture.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all",Communist Manifesto
61,"intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism",Communist Manifesto
61,ended in a miserable fit of the blues.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"C. German, or ""True,"" Socialism",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature",Communist Manifesto
61,"that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and",Communist Manifesto
61,"that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was",Communist Manifesto
61,"introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that",Communist Manifesto
61,"country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits,",Communist Manifesto
61,"eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when",Communist Manifesto
61,"these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social",Communist Manifesto
61,conditions had not immigrated along with them.  In contact with,Communist Manifesto
61,"German social conditions, this French literature lost all its",Communist Manifesto
61,"immediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary",Communist Manifesto
61,"aspect.  Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth",Communist Manifesto
61,"century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing",Communist Manifesto
61,"more than the demands of ""Practical Reason"" in general, and the",Communist Manifesto
61,utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie,Communist Manifesto
61,"signified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was",Communist Manifesto
61,"bound to be, of true human Will generally.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing,Communist Manifesto
61,the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical,Communist Manifesto
61,"conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without",Communist Manifesto
61,deserting their own philosophic point of view.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign,Communist Manifesto
61,"language is appropriated, namely, by translation.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic,Communist Manifesto
61,Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of,Communist Manifesto
61,ancient heathendom had been written.  The German literate,Communist Manifesto
61,reversed this process with the profane French literature.  They,Communist Manifesto
61,wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.,Communist Manifesto
61,"For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic",Communist Manifesto
61,"functions of money, they wrote ""Alienation of Humanity,"" and",Communist Manifesto
61,beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote,Communist Manifesto
61,"""dethronement of the Category of the General,"" and so forth.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of,Communist Manifesto
61,"the French historical criticisms they dubbed ""Philosophy of",Communist Manifesto
61,"Action,"" ""True Socialism,"" ""German Science of Socialism,""",Communist Manifesto
61,"""Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,"" and so on.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely,Communist Manifesto
61,"emasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express",Communist Manifesto
61,"the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having",Communist Manifesto
61,"overcome ""French one-sidedness"" and of representing, not true",Communist Manifesto
61,"requirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who",Communist Manifesto
61,"belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm",Communist Manifesto
61,of philosophical fantasy.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"This German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously",Communist Manifesto
61,"and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such",Communist Manifesto
61,"mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic",Communist Manifesto
61,innocence.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie,",Communist Manifesto
61,"against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the",Communist Manifesto
61,"liberal movement, became more earnest.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"By this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to ""True""",Communist Manifesto
61,Socialism of confronting the political movement with the,Communist Manifesto
61,"Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas",Communist Manifesto
61,"against liberalism, against representative government, against",Communist Manifesto
61,"bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois",Communist Manifesto
61,"legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to",Communist Manifesto
61,"the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose,",Communist Manifesto
61,"by this bourgeois movement.  German Socialism forgot, in the nick",Communist Manifesto
61,"of time, that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was,",Communist Manifesto
61,"presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its",Communist Manifesto
61,"corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political",Communist Manifesto
61,"constitution adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment",Communist Manifesto
61,was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,",Communist Manifesto
61,"professors, country squires and officials, it served as a welcome",Communist Manifesto
61,scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,It was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and,Communist Manifesto
61,"bullets with which these same governments, just at that time,",Communist Manifesto
61,dosed the German working-class risings.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"While this ""True"" Socialism thus served the governments as a",Communist Manifesto
61,"weapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time,",Communist Manifesto
61,"directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"German Philistines.  In Germany the petty-bourgeois class, a",Communist Manifesto
61,"relic of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly",Communist Manifesto
61,"cropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis",Communist Manifesto
61,of the existing state of things.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of,Communist Manifesto
61,things in Germany.  The industrial and political supremacy of the,Communist Manifesto
61,bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction; on the one,Communist Manifesto
61,"hand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the",Communist Manifesto
61,"rise of a revolutionary proletariat.  ""True"" Socialism appeared to",Communist Manifesto
61,kill these two birds with one stone.  It spread like an epidemic.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers",Communist Manifesto
61,"of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this",Communist Manifesto
61,transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their,Communist Manifesto
61,"sorry ""eternal truths,"" all skin and bone, served to wonderfully",Communist Manifesto
61,increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public.  And on,Communist Manifesto
61,"its part, German Socialism recognised, more and more, its own",Communist Manifesto
61,calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois,Communist Manifesto
61,Philistine.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the",Communist Manifesto
61,German petty Philistine to be the typical man.  To every,Communist Manifesto
61,"villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden, higher,",Communist Manifesto
61,"Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real",Communist Manifesto
61,character.  It went to the extreme length of directly opposing,Communist Manifesto
61,"the ""brutally destructive"" tendency of Communism, and of",Communist Manifesto
61,proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class,Communist Manifesto
61,"struggles.  With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist",Communist Manifesto
61,and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany,Communist Manifesto
61,belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.,Communist Manifesto

61,"reformers of every imaginable kind.  This form of Socialism has,",Communist Manifesto
61,"moreover, been worked out into complete systems.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,We may cite Proudhon's Philosophie de la Misere as an example of,Communist Manifesto
61,this form.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern,Communist Manifesto
61,social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily,Communist Manifesto
61,resulting therefrom.  They desire the existing state of society,Communist Manifesto
61,minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements.  They wish,Communist Manifesto
61,for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.  The bourgeoisie,Communist Manifesto
61,naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the,Communist Manifesto
61,best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable,Communist Manifesto
61,conception into various more or less complete systems.  In,Communist Manifesto
61,"requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby",Communist Manifesto
61,"to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but",Communist Manifesto
61,"requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within",Communist Manifesto
61,"the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its",Communist Manifesto
61,hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"A second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this",Communist Manifesto
61,Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in,Communist Manifesto
61,"the eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political",Communist Manifesto
61,"reform, but only a change in the material conditions of",Communist Manifesto
61,"existence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to",Communist Manifesto
61,"them.  By changes in the material conditions of existence, this",Communist Manifesto
61,"form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of",Communist Manifesto
61,"the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be",Communist Manifesto
61,"effected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based",Communist Manifesto
61,"on the continued existence of these relations; reforms,",Communist Manifesto

61,Free trade: for the benefit of the working class.  Protective,Communist Manifesto

61,the benefit of the working class.  This is the last word and the,Communist Manifesto
61,only seriously meant word of bourgeois Socialism.,Communist Manifesto

61,3.  CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great",Communist Manifesto
61,"modern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.",Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own,Communist Manifesto
61,"ends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society",Communist Manifesto
61,"was being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing",Communist Manifesto
61,"to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to",Communist Manifesto
61,"the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation,",Communist Manifesto
61,"conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced",Communist Manifesto
61,by the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary,Communist Manifesto
61,literature that accompanied these first movements of the,Communist Manifesto
61,proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It,Communist Manifesto
61,inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its,Communist Manifesto
61,crudest form.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of",Communist Manifesto
61,"Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others, spring into existence in",Communist Manifesto
61,"the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle",Communist Manifesto
61,between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois,Communist Manifesto
61,and Proletarians).,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as",Communist Manifesto
61,"well as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form",Communist Manifesto

61,the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any,Communist Manifesto
61,independent political movement.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with,Communist Manifesto
61,"the development of industry, the economic situation, as they find",Communist Manifesto
61,"it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the",Communist Manifesto
61,emancipation of the proletariat.  They therefore search after a,Communist Manifesto
61,"new social science, after new social laws, that are to create",Communist Manifesto
61,these conditions.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive,Communist Manifesto
61,"action, historically created conditions of emancipation to",Communist Manifesto
61,"fantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation",Communist Manifesto
61,of the proletariat to the organisation of society specially,Communist Manifesto
61,"contrived by these inventors.  Future history resolves itself, in",Communist Manifesto
61,"their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of",Communist Manifesto
61,their social plans.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,In the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring,Communist Manifesto
61,"chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most",Communist Manifesto
61,suffering class.  Only from the point of view of being the most,Communist Manifesto
61,suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their",Communist Manifesto
61,"own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider",Communist Manifesto
61,themselves far superior to all class antagonisms.  They want to,Communist Manifesto
61,"improve the condition of every member of society, even that of",Communist Manifesto
61,"the most favoured.  Hence, they habitually appeal to society at",Communist Manifesto
61,"large, without  distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the",Communist Manifesto
61,"ruling class.  For how can people, when once they understand",Communist Manifesto
61,"their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the",Communist Manifesto
61,best possible state of society?,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Hence, they reject all political, and especially all",Communist Manifesto
61,"revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by",Communist Manifesto
61,"peaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily",Communist Manifesto
61,"doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way",Communist Manifesto
61,for the new social Gospel.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,"Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time",Communist Manifesto
61,when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has,Communist Manifesto

61,the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general,Communist Manifesto
61,reconstruction of society.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a,Communist Manifesto
61,critical element. They attack every principle of existing society.,Communist Manifesto
61,Hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the,Communist Manifesto
61,enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures,Communist Manifesto
61,proposed in them--such as the abolition of the distinction,Communist Manifesto
61,"between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of",Communist Manifesto
61,"industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage",Communist Manifesto
61,"system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the",Communist Manifesto
61,"functions of the State into a mere superintendence of production,",Communist Manifesto
61,"all these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class",Communist Manifesto
61,"antagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and",Communist Manifesto
61,"which, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest,",Communist Manifesto
61,"indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore,",Communist Manifesto
61,are of a purely Utopian character.,Communist Manifesto
61,,Communist Manifesto
61,The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism,Communist Manifesto
61,bears an inverse relation to historical development.  In,Communist Manifesto
61,proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes,Communist Manifesto
61,"definite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest,",Communist Manifesto
61,"these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all",Communist Manifesto
61,"theoretical justification.  Therefore, although the originators",Communist Manifesto
61,"of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their",Communist Manifesto
61,"disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects.",Communist Manifesto
61,"They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in",Communist Manifesto
61,opposition to the progressive historical development of the,Communist Manifesto
61,"proletariat.  They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently,",Communist Manifesto
