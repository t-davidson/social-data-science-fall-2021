# What is agent-based modeling?
## Agent-based modeling and quantitative social science
- Most quantitative social science is variable-centered
  - e.g. We study the associations and interactions between variables in a linear regression
  
# What is agent-based modeling?
## Agent-based modeling and quantitative social science
- As a consequence, many sociologists think about the world in terms of what Andrew Abbott calls "general linear reality"
  - A social world composed of fixed entities with fixed attributes
  - Statistical analysis consists of finding patterns of relationships between these attributes
    - e.g. We add gender, race, sex, education, income to a model and assume linear  relationships between variables
    
# What is agent-based modeling?
## Agent-based modeling and quantitative social science
- Agent-based modeling is the study of "social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive." (Macy and Willer 2002)
  - Rather than interactions between variables, we consider interactions between interdependent individuals
  
# What is agent-based modeling?
## Agent-based modeling and quantitative social science  
- Often we are interested in the *emergent* properties of local interactions between agents and how they aggregate into system-level processes such as diffusion, polarization, and segregation
  - These complex system-level patterns can emerge without any centralized coordination
- Like historical sociology and ethnography, agent-based modeling is a *relational* approach, focusing on the context-dependent and contingent nature of social interaction

# What is agent-based modeling?
## Key assumptions
- Macy and Willer 2002 outline four key assumptions that underpin many sociological agent-based models
  - Agents are *autonomous*
    - There is no system-wide coordination
  - Agents are *interdependent*
    - Agents respond to each other and to their environment
  - Agents follow *simple rules*
    - Simple local rules can generate global complexity
  - Agents are *adaptive* and *backwards looking*
    - Agents can alter their behavior through processes such as imitation and learning

# What is agent-based modeling?
## Advantages of ABMs
- Virtual experiments to test causal mechanisms
  - Particularly useful where real-world experimentation is impractical
- Theory building and testing
  - Bridging between micro and macro levels of analysis
  - Varying the social structure *and* the agency of individuals

# What is agent-based modeling?
## Realism
- Bruch and Atwell (2015) distinguish between two types of realism in ABMs
  - *Low-dimensional realism*: simple, parsimonious models
  - *High-dimensional realism*: complex, complicated models
- Trade-offs:
  - The latter might be more realistic, but involve more parameters and may be less intelligible

# What is agent-based modeling?
## Parameters and sensitivity
- Use theory to guide decisions regarding which parameters vary and should be fixed
- How do system-wide outcomes vary as we adjust parameters?
- Models can be extremely sensitive to small variations in parameters
  - Be careful to check for coding errors!
- Timing matters
  - Constant time vs. discrete-time
  - Asynchronous vs. synchronous updating

# NetLogo and NetLogoWeb
## Running agent-based models
- NetLogo is a widely used environment for constructing agent-based models, storing, and visualizing results
- NetLogoWeb is a browser version with many examples (https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch)
- There are various interfaces with R to run NetLogo, but I have not used them (e.g. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetLogo/RNetLogo.pdf)

# Building an agent-based model
## A simple contagion model in R
- Let's simulate a contagion among a population of agents
- Assumptions
  - Agents interact at random
  - Transmission probability is constant for all agents
  - No agent is immune

# Building an agent-based model
## Generating agents
I use the ``setClass`` option to define a new class called ``agent`` with two different numeric properties, ``id`` and ``infected``. I then use ``new`` t create two different instances of the class.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
setClass("agent", slots=list(
  id="numeric",
  infected="numeric"
))

a <- new("agent", id=100, infected=0)
b <- new("agent", id=101, infected=1)
```

# Building an agent-based model
## Generating agents
The agents are what are known as ``S4`` classes in R. This means that all slots must be of the correct type. e.g. We cannot set ``id`` to be characters.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
print(a@id)
print(a@infected)
#a@id <- 'a' # uncomment and run to produce error
```
\tiny Read more about S4 classes here: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html

# Building an agent-based model
## Generating agents
We can use a function to generate a set of N agents and store them in a list.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
agent.generator <- function(N){
  agents <- list()
  for (i in 1:N) {
    agents[[i]] <- new("agent", id=i,infected=0)
  }
  return(agents)
}

agent.generator(4)
```

# Building an agent-based model
## Interaction protocols
Next we want to define how agents interact. This function takes a focal agent, indexed by ``i``, and randomly selects another agent ``j``, where ``i`` is not equal to ``j``.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
select.partner <- function(i, N){ # i is the focal agent
    ids <- c(1:N) # define list of IDs
    ids <- ids[-i] # remove ith id
    j <- sample(ids, 1) # pick j at random
  return(j)
}
```

# Building an agent-based model
## Interaction protocols
The next function, ``interact``, defines how agents ``i`` and ``j`` interact, in this case, whether the virus spreads. Parameter ``P`` denotes the probability of transmission. Note the function takes and modifies the entire list of agents.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
interact <- function(agents, i, j, P){
  if (agents[[i]]@infected == agents[[j]]@infected) {} # no action if same status
  else if (agents[[i]]@infected == 1) {
    # infect j with P
    agents[[j]]@infected <- rbinom(n=1, size=1, prob=P)
  } else {
    # infect i with P
    agents[[i]]@infected <- rbinom(n=1, size=1, prob=P)
  }
  return(agents)
}
```

# Building an agent-based model
## Putting together a simulation
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
simulator <- function(N, t, P, agents){
  results <- numeric(t) # 0 vector of length t
  agents[[sample(1:N, 1)]]@infected <- 1 # randomly infect 1 agent
  for (timestep in 1:t) { # for each timestep
    for (i in sample(1:N)) { # for reach agent
      j <- select.partner(i, N) # selected a partner
      agents <- interact(agents, i, j, P) # interact
    }
    statuses <- numeric(N) 
    for (i in 1:N) {statuses[[i]] <- agents[[i]]@infected}
    results[[timestep]] <- sum(statuses)/N # prop infected at timestep
    }
  return(list("results"=results, 
              "agents"=agents))
}
```


# Building an agent-based model
## Running a single simulation
Here we define the relevant parameters, generate a set of agents, and run ``simulator``.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
N = 500 # agents
P = .05 # transmission probability
t= 100 # timesteps

set.seed(478437) # set randomization seed

agents <- agent.generator(N) # gen N agents
r <- simulator(N, t, P, agents) # run sim

print(r$results)
```

# Building an agent-based model
The graphic shows the proportion infected at each timestep.
```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
plot(r$results)
```


# Building an agent-based model
## Running multiple simulations
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
K = 10 # trials
results.matrix <- matrix(nrow=K*t, ncol=3)

i <- 1 # iterator
for (k in 1:K) {
  print(k)
  agents <- agent.generator(N)
  results <- simulator(N, t, P, agents)
  timestep <- 1
  for (r in results$results) {
    results.matrix[i,] <- c(r,timestep,k)
    timestep <- timestep + 1
    i <- i + 1
  }
  
}
```

```



# Building an agent-based model
## Varying P
Now we want to examine how the results vary across different transmission probabilities.
```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
P.vals <- c(0.1,0.2,0.3) # added three different variations of P

results.matrix <- matrix(nrow=K*t*length(P.vals), ncol=4) # Define a new results matrix
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, mysize=TRUE, size='\\footnotesize', tidy=FALSE}
i <- 1
for (P in P.vals) { 
    for (k in 1:K) {
      agents <- agent.generator(N)
      results <- simulator(N, t, P, agents)
      timestep <- 1
      for (r in results$results) {
        results.matrix[i,] <- c(r,timestep,P,k)
        timestep <- timestep + 1
        i <- i + 1
      }
    }
}
```

# Building an agent-based model
## Back to our assumptions
- So far this model is very simple. What are some of the assumptions it makes?

# Building an agent-based model
## Back to our assumptions
- So far this model is very simple. What are some of the assumptions I make?
  - Only groups, square and circles
    - Each group has the same tendency towards homophily
    - Each group is the same size
  - Homophily and transmission probability are constant
  - Within-group, interactions are random
    - All relationships are possible, there are no structural holes
  - No agent is immune / non-compliant

# Building an agent-based model
## Back to our assumptions
- The main challenge when constructing an ABM is to determine which parameters are theoretically relevant and how to operationalize them
- For example, if we considered this as a model of cultural transmission it is important to recognize that culture does not spread like a virus (Goldberg and Stein 2018)
  - But how does culture diffuse? The onus is on the modeler to develop a parsimonious mechanism and implement it in code
- This is difficult, but it forces us to think carefully about our theories and our assumptions

# Summary
- Agent-based modeling allows us to simulate complex social systems
  - Interdependent, emergent, relational
- The technique has been used by sociologists to study a range of different processes and to develop and test theories
  - But there are difficult trade-offs between parsimony (low-dimensional realism) and complexity (high-dimensional realism)
- NetLogo provides a suite of tools for agent-based modeling
- R's object-oriented functionality can be used to create models
